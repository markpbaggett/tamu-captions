00:30.000 --> 00:50.920
I'm Tom Turbiewill.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.800
Captain Gerald Roup is a proud okey who has lived in the praises valley for the better

00:54.800 --> 01:00.740
part of 38 years. A sound officer in World War II and what's a sound officer? There's

01:00.740 --> 01:05.720
a good chance that like me you don't know about sound and flash, but you will find out

01:05.720 --> 01:10.940
that his was not a large unit but quite a valuable one. That put itself deeply in harm's

01:10.940 --> 01:14.820
way through combat at the Battle of the Bulge and other resistance in their march through

01:14.820 --> 01:20.080
France and into Germany. Welcome, Captain Gerald Roup to Veterans of the Valley. You grew up

01:20.080 --> 01:25.600
in Oklahoma. You are a proud okey. You Oklahoma class in 1942 and it didn't take long after

01:25.600 --> 01:30.440
graduation that you were in the service in January of 43. I want to get right into what

01:30.440 --> 01:34.840
is sound and flash, Captain Roup, because a lot of people might not be familiar with this

01:34.840 --> 01:41.040
really a sort of survey operation of World War II. What sound in flash? Sound in flash,

01:41.040 --> 01:49.240
Tom, is the common name given to a field artillery observation battalion. There are two

01:49.240 --> 01:58.440
batteries, each made up of one sound platoon and one flash platoon. Just as the name implies,

01:58.440 --> 02:07.360
sound actually the purpose of the unit is to locate enemy artillery. Sound basically

02:07.360 --> 02:19.440
means that you put six microphones out about a mile apart over a five mile period area.

02:19.440 --> 02:29.520
Then you connect these to a machine in the command post. We have an operator out front who

02:29.520 --> 02:36.720
pushes a button when a shell goes over and it activates the machine and prints out on

02:36.720 --> 02:47.920
tape the time that each microphone received the burst. Then since these are plotted by survey

02:47.920 --> 02:57.400
on a plotting board, you can figure the difference in time that each shell hit the microphone and

02:57.400 --> 03:06.400
back plot to locate the source of the sound or the gun. And if you get enough of these over

03:06.400 --> 03:11.920
a period of time, then you'll know that you have a good plot and the information is given to

03:13.280 --> 03:22.800
the core. We were core troops. And then they would fire and try to eliminate the gun.

03:22.800 --> 03:27.440
Exactly. Basically that's it. This was really high tech for this time. I mean it sounds

03:27.440 --> 03:32.320
high tech to me right now, but this was high tech for this time extremely wasn't. Very much so.

03:32.880 --> 03:37.920
Of course it's pretty primitive now considering the way things are done. Now 1600 yards apart,

03:37.920 --> 03:41.520
the reason for that because that had to do with the speed of sound between the microphones is

03:41.520 --> 03:47.680
absolutely right. You put them four sound seconds apart and sound generally travels around 400

03:47.680 --> 03:53.520
yards per second, depending on a lot of factors. But you spread on far enough that you could cover a

03:53.520 --> 04:01.040
wide area, but they had to be as far forward as you could put them, which put the survey crews that

04:01.120 --> 04:07.280
put in the mics in danger because they were quite out a lot of times in the open. And the OPs,

04:07.280 --> 04:14.960
the outposts were up with the infantry outposts. So my command post had to of course be as far

04:14.960 --> 04:20.960
forward as it could be because you had to run a line from each microphone back to the CP.

04:22.080 --> 04:28.880
So it was a little bit of an arduous situation. Exactly. Now that was sound and that was your

04:28.880 --> 04:33.840
specialty. That's out of sound. But explain what flash was. Alright. Flash is just as the word says,

04:34.480 --> 04:40.800
you set up two optical instruments at a certain distance part. You measure the distance between them.

04:41.600 --> 04:48.480
Generally in a church steeple or a high building or some place where they can see. And most of it was

04:48.480 --> 04:56.480
done at night all of them. They could see flashes during the daytime. Both OPs would zero in on a

04:56.480 --> 05:04.000
flash. And by trigonometry, since you knew the distance between the two and the angles,

05:04.000 --> 05:10.880
you had the angle at the apex so you could locate the sources. Done. So all those students taking

05:10.880 --> 05:15.600
trigonometry and wondering what are we taking this for? It certainly came in handy as far as

05:15.600 --> 05:20.240
this particular operation in World War II. Exactly. Right. OPs of course that's your outpost, CP,

05:20.240 --> 05:26.240
that's your command post. And I want to move on because you went on to a camp Gordon

05:26.240 --> 05:32.160
Georgia and you started this new sound and flash unit in 1944. Went overseas in September of

05:32.160 --> 05:39.040
1940. Let's talk about that because you landed at Omaha Beach. This was about three months after,

05:39.040 --> 05:44.560
of course, D-Day. But sort of talk about what Omaha Beach in Normandy was like three months later.

05:44.560 --> 05:50.400
Alright. Initially we landed at Liverpool. It took a train to Southampton and got on a boat

05:50.480 --> 05:56.000
and went directly across the channel to Omaha Beach. There wasn't anything there except the

05:56.000 --> 06:02.960
wrecked buildings, the concrete gun emplacements, the Germans that had. I think we all, I never

06:02.960 --> 06:09.920
asked the Colonel why, but I think he wanted the honor of maybe landing on Omaha Beach. But we did.

06:09.920 --> 06:16.720
Right. And I thought gee, they must need us pretty bad because here we are a week after we landed

06:17.440 --> 06:22.400
back in France. Well, we sat there for six weeks waiting for our equipment to arrive. Right

06:22.400 --> 06:26.400
there at the Sherborg Peninsula waiting for the equipment. So you sort of cooled your heels there

06:26.400 --> 06:32.080
for a while, right? In the mud and the rain. Yes. Late October 1944 though you were in combat and

06:32.080 --> 06:36.080
we're talking about the wintertime and we start talking about the battle of the bulge. The people I

06:36.080 --> 06:39.040
have visited with that were involved in the battle of the bulge. The first thing they talk about

06:39.040 --> 06:44.640
is the weather. The bitter, bitter cold. Talk about your memories of that. Well, the cold weather

06:44.720 --> 06:51.760
really didn't start until about the time of the bulge. About the, it was 16th of December. Right.

06:51.760 --> 06:59.120
Exactly. Right. But during that time we had moved, the army had moved up to the edge of Germany.

06:59.120 --> 07:03.520
And of course everybody was optimistic. You know, we're going to be in Berlin by Christmas.

07:03.520 --> 07:09.440
Well, it didn't work that way. The Germans and the weather turned out to be a key factor. So it

07:09.440 --> 07:19.920
snowed and got cold and was miserable. It was the coldest winter of the century.

07:19.920 --> 07:27.840
Right. Winter of 1944-45. Right. And we had problems with frostbite. Of course you lived out in

07:27.840 --> 07:35.520
dugouts when we were in the Hurtken Forest, east of Aachen. So it was all in all, not a very pleasant

07:35.520 --> 07:42.560
experience at that time. And your units during some of this time were taking resistance,

07:42.560 --> 07:50.560
taking fire. And you were not a combat troop though. No. We were non-combat troops in the combat

07:50.560 --> 07:56.080
zone. Exactly. I used to wonder why and it was never visited by some of the battalion people.

07:56.800 --> 08:01.760
But they were smart enough to stay back where they were. But we got a lot of artillery incoming

08:02.400 --> 08:10.720
during that period after the bulge and until actually around the first part of February when

08:10.720 --> 08:15.760
they crossed the Royal River and moved on east. Right. But your job was to place these microphones

08:15.760 --> 08:24.000
really out in front of the front. Exactly. So you were indeed in the front. This must have been a

08:24.000 --> 08:29.440
rather harrowing ordeal from time to time. Well, it's the survey crews and the communications

08:29.440 --> 08:36.000
people that really caught the brunt of it. Yes, sir. We lost a number of survey men and the

08:36.000 --> 08:41.040
communications people, the wire man, had to replace the wire and the microphones because

08:41.040 --> 08:46.400
GIs would see those mics and all they had warning signs on them. They knew telling what they

08:46.400 --> 08:51.040
do to them. Right. You got orders to move on to the Elbriver, the Battle of the Bulge here,

08:51.040 --> 08:57.040
early 1945. The bulge was actually over but your battalion was ordered to the Elbin. It was

08:57.520 --> 09:02.240
something like a 200 mile march, is that right? This was after we had crossed the Rhine. Right.

09:03.600 --> 09:12.960
About the middle of April. Thereabouts. Yes. Right. We were sitting after the battle of the

09:12.960 --> 09:20.080
Ruhr or that so many hundred thousand Germans were captured. We figured the war was about over.

09:20.640 --> 09:25.200
And we didn't have anything to do. We had a base out but there wasn't any ranging. So we figured

09:26.080 --> 09:32.560
we were done, you know, sitting there fat, dumb and happy. Lots of German beer and good food.

09:33.520 --> 09:40.880
Then we got orders to move to the Elbriver. Right. They pronounced it Elba, I think. I don't know why

09:40.880 --> 09:50.400
we did but we did a 200 mile march in one day. We moved by batteries. Right. And during the march,

09:51.280 --> 09:57.680
I was a little bit skeptical because the infantry had not moved nearly that far. They were still

09:57.680 --> 10:05.360
involved in the Ruhr Valley. Right. Now about this time the Americans had met the Russians down

10:07.120 --> 10:13.920
the town was a tow bar, a tow bar or something down below Magdeburg on the Elbriver. Right.

10:14.880 --> 10:24.240
That was about the 25th of April. But we were fired. We ran on our march. We ran through several

10:24.240 --> 10:30.160
groups of Germans and got fired on. In fact, they tore up one truck and killed the officer and

10:30.160 --> 10:36.320
several enlisted men in the truck. And at that point I began to wonder why we were where we were.

10:36.320 --> 10:41.280
Right. But we've been told to go. So when you're in the army you go where they tell you to. Right.

10:41.920 --> 10:46.400
The Germans at this time were sort of in a mode of surrender. They felt that the war was coming

10:46.400 --> 10:51.680
to an end. You didn't know exactly what the mode of the war was for the Russians. So you were all

10:51.680 --> 10:55.600
sort of playing the game there finding out what the Russians were doing and you thought that

10:55.600 --> 11:00.400
your movement to the Elbriver may have something to do with monitoring Russian artillery operations.

11:00.400 --> 11:10.320
Right. When we got to the Elba about the 25th of April, the Germans had just started to surrender.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.200
Elb at the Elba at that point is about 40 miles west of Berlin. And the Russians had just gotten

11:17.200 --> 11:26.080
into Berlin and were devastating it. So the big march of Germans trying to surrender came out

11:26.080 --> 11:32.400
after we got there to the Elb. So yeah, I think they put us there because they were a little

11:32.400 --> 11:37.680
concerned that maybe the Russians said we had given orders. We'd been given orders not across the

11:37.680 --> 11:44.800
Elb from Eisenhower. Right. So they were concerned that maybe the Russians would come into that

11:44.800 --> 11:52.400
area and who knew what they would do. Right. So we were up there to range on Russian artillery in

11:52.400 --> 11:57.600
case they began to move towards the Elb River. Right. There's a couple of stories that you told me

11:57.600 --> 12:02.880
that I want to make sure that we tell. We may not be operating in the right order here. But talk about

12:03.520 --> 12:12.560
the when you went and the train full of POWs that you sort of escorted back. That was a quite a sight that you'll

12:12.560 --> 12:17.120
never forget. There were two there were three train cars I believe through full of German POWs.

12:17.120 --> 12:22.960
This was while we were still at Sherberg, Brunenzela. They sent me and another officer in several

12:22.960 --> 12:31.600
enlisted men up in Belgium to pick up a train load of German POWs. Right. And we ended up hauling

12:31.600 --> 12:42.560
50 freight cars full of Germans 50 to a car back to the Sherberg area. So that was that was

12:42.560 --> 12:48.480
something that you'll never forget and but they did get back they were prisoners but they did

12:48.480 --> 12:52.560
get back. December the 16th you mentioned that date you also mentioned that that's sort of a special

12:52.560 --> 12:58.400
date because in your mind three historical things happened on that date. They did. The first was

12:58.960 --> 13:04.160
the battle of the ball started. Right. Second was General Eisenhower got his fifth star.

13:04.960 --> 13:10.160
And third I was promoted to first lieutenant. All that happened on December the 16th. I wasn't on

13:10.160 --> 13:14.640
the same orders with General Eisenhower obviously. You can find two of those three things in history

13:14.640 --> 13:19.840
books right. Right. And your own history you remember that. There was an outcome to what you all

13:19.840 --> 13:25.760
did is far from sound operation and the outcome I believe you said was some 65 enemy gun positions

13:25.760 --> 13:32.160
were located so that was our initial location in the Hurtgen Forest. Right. Yes. Right. We were

13:32.160 --> 13:38.640
there for about six weeks and during the winter the worst part of it and they told us later

13:38.640 --> 13:47.120
corps did that we had located and they had gotten rid of some 65 German gun positions. Right.

13:47.120 --> 13:51.440
Now I want to go ahead and fast forward back to the Elbriever because when you were here in

13:51.440 --> 13:55.680
setting up your command post you were able to set up a command post that was a little bit more

13:55.680 --> 14:01.280
luxurious than the command post that you had seen. It was a three story hunting lodge that belonged to

14:01.280 --> 14:06.080
a German Baron sort of described this place and sort of the luxury of this place. It wasn't a

14:06.080 --> 14:11.600
bad place to be and the Baron wasn't a bad guy. He was a nice fella. Yes sir. It was it was the

14:11.600 --> 14:18.240
finest of any CP's we had the whole time. Right. He had been a Lieutenant Colonel in the German

14:18.240 --> 14:23.120
Army. Very wounded. Very it's in place. It's in place. Right. And was wounded and retired.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.560
His house in the Berlin had been destroyed so they had moved out to this three story hunting lodge.

14:30.560 --> 14:36.160
Right. Which we have a picture of later. A lot later. Right. But as soon as it was about a half

14:36.160 --> 14:41.520
a mile from the Elbriever and as soon as I saw it I told my master sergeant I said we're going

14:41.520 --> 14:48.080
to end the war right here in luxury. So he and I went in and talked to the Colonel. He had his

14:48.080 --> 14:53.440
family. He was there. He had three children I believe. Yes sir. And he was glad to see us really.

14:53.440 --> 15:01.760
Right. We weren't the Russians. But he moved out to his sergeant quarters. Right. And gave us the

15:01.760 --> 15:09.520
house. And so we stayed there until the war was over and we moved on back into the battalion area.

15:09.520 --> 15:13.120
Before we go to the pictures of some of the artifacts from the war that you've got along with

15:13.120 --> 15:16.400
you I want you to tell one more story when you were there. You were just sort of trying to

15:16.400 --> 15:20.800
while away your time and you and your buck sergeant. A fellow named Dusty Roach decided to take

15:20.800 --> 15:26.160
a little trip. Talk about what happened on that trip. Well I don't know whether I'm proud of it

15:26.160 --> 15:32.560
or not but we did it. But Dusty and I were up at the river one day and Germans were coming across

15:32.560 --> 15:40.400
and my my platoon was unhappy because they hadn't gotten any pistols and he looogers. Right. So I told

15:40.400 --> 15:45.600
Dusty I said let's take one of these rubber boats these Germans coming across with and go on

15:45.600 --> 15:51.680
across the river and see what we can find. So just as we got to the other side the river is about

15:51.680 --> 15:59.200
50 yards wide there. A little car pulled up and four German officers got out and I said something

15:59.200 --> 16:06.080
like are you through with your car and one of them said it sure is glad to hear English again.

16:06.640 --> 16:12.160
He told me he'd been he was a doctor an MD from Brooklyn who had gone back to Germany

16:12.960 --> 16:18.320
apparently early in the war and got stuck there and spent the whole time in the war. Right. Now

16:18.320 --> 16:23.920
if that's that was his story I should have gotten his name but they were in a hurry to go on west.

16:23.920 --> 16:29.920
Yes. So we got in the car turned it around and headed east and leisurely driving along it was

16:29.920 --> 16:37.680
a nice day you know nothing happening nobody around and Dusty said Lieutenant we're not going

16:37.680 --> 16:44.720
to learn to Berlin are we and I said I don't think so we driven maybe 10 or 15 minutes and about

16:44.720 --> 16:53.840
that time here comes three great big German trucks enormous with steak bodies full of German soldiers

16:55.120 --> 17:02.480
probably 50 in each truck just jammed in you know to get get away so I got out stopped car and

17:02.480 --> 17:08.960
got out and held my hand up and said halt I said throw all of your weapons over here on the side

17:09.600 --> 17:16.320
and go on up to the river and surrender and I guess we were the first GI's these fellas had seen

17:17.280 --> 17:24.320
so not a peep out of any of them they threw through the guns over and belts and took off

17:24.880 --> 17:29.520
so we hung the pistols on the belts and turned the car around and went back to the river

17:29.760 --> 17:35.600
he said you got into some 175 pistols that that you got out of that so what do you think when you

17:35.600 --> 17:40.320
got out of the out of your car and held held your hand up to these three trucks full I mean the war

17:40.320 --> 17:48.560
was still going on oh I know it it worked out good didn't it I'm really I'm really not honored to

17:48.560 --> 17:53.280
have been there but it was a dubious dubious distinction maybe that's right and you think that

17:53.280 --> 17:57.200
because of that even though you didn't know whether you were supposed to been on the other side

17:57.200 --> 18:03.040
of the river that quite possibly you and Sergeant Rhodes may have gotten the closest to Berlin of

18:03.040 --> 18:09.760
anybody in the war on the ground on the ground yeah I did I didn't publicize what I had done

18:09.760 --> 18:14.960
right because we had orders not to cross the L exactly but you weren't in a combat boat we weren't

18:14.960 --> 18:19.120
attacking anybody right right right let's go to some photographs and then we've got some artifacts

18:19.120 --> 18:25.440
here that you brought back from the war let's go to some few photographs that Captain Roup here

18:25.520 --> 18:30.720
you are talk about you can look right over there on that monitor right there and you can tell us

18:30.720 --> 18:36.080
about where are you there well that was somewhere in Germany Tom but I'm not sure it was where I

18:36.080 --> 18:43.600
had a CP command post right and must been in the spring because I didn't have many heavy jackets on

18:43.600 --> 18:51.120
exactly okay let's move on to the next photograph now here is the here's the hunting lodge that's

18:51.120 --> 18:55.360
the Baron's hunting lodge and your command post I think you said what second floor the right three

18:55.360 --> 19:00.960
windows well the command post was all the second floor all the second floor and that we it was

19:00.960 --> 19:08.000
large enough that the whole platoon lived in there exactly lived in and the third floor was a big

19:08.000 --> 19:14.320
ballroom yes sir that they had stored a lot of stuff in right no damage whatsoever it was

19:14.320 --> 19:20.160
beautiful place probably built back in the middle 1800s and we've got a picture coming up of the

19:20.720 --> 19:26.240
of the Baron there he is there's a Baron it's in place that's him wearing the uniform that

19:26.240 --> 19:30.800
that we're gonna see we're gonna see this uniform we're gonna get a close-up of this this uniform

19:30.800 --> 19:36.240
that you're seeing right here we have in the studio today and the hat and the belt everything but the

19:36.240 --> 19:40.640
pants yes what happened to the pants they got laws and the boots as a matter of fact we have

19:40.640 --> 19:47.120
those in the studio right okay quite a distinct talk about this I think people anybody that saw

19:47.120 --> 19:51.360
the movie the longest day and remember the character that was played by red buttons I believe in

19:51.360 --> 19:56.800
that movie will remember this scene this is actually what it looks like today I guess what was that

19:57.760 --> 20:04.800
three years ago my two sons and I went back to France and spent a week on the Normandy Peninsula

20:04.800 --> 20:11.520
and this church is in St. Mary Glees which is the nearest little town to Omaha Beach and it was

20:11.520 --> 20:20.240
the first town that was gotten to by the GI's right this is an effigy that they keep hanging there

20:20.800 --> 20:29.840
to commemorate the D-Day parachute drum right and that was depicted in that movie that's

20:29.840 --> 20:34.000
well a part by red button so I believe just passed away this last year the actor did I believe

20:34.000 --> 20:39.040
that's played part in that movie that's pretty fascinating okay let's move on I think we've got

20:39.040 --> 20:43.920
a couple of others these are German POWs that are surrendering where is this one taking this

20:43.920 --> 20:51.760
is at the Elbe where we where I had my CP close by right the bridge had been blown of course so

20:52.640 --> 20:59.440
they they used rubber boats and anything they could find to get on across in a 10-day period there

20:59.440 --> 21:04.560
they said that something like a million Germans surrendered right getting away from getting away

21:04.560 --> 21:12.160
from the Russians okay I think we've got and here is your your unit and you are a middle sitting

21:12.160 --> 21:19.520
in the middle center that's my sound platoon made up of the survey people and the the communications

21:19.520 --> 21:26.960
people and the CP personnel right command both personnel one a very large unit that was the A

21:26.960 --> 21:33.280
unit right that was A battery A battery the sound right yes right fascinating pictures and we have

21:33.280 --> 21:38.160
some fascinating things we we talked about the uniform and as a matter of fact the uniform is

21:38.160 --> 21:42.480
right here to the the side of you we're going to go ahead and take a closer look at that and sort

21:42.480 --> 21:47.680
of describe what we're looking at this is the barren's uniform that how did it come by that he

21:47.680 --> 21:56.800
just handed it over to you I think he was so glad to see us that we hadn't destroyed anything of his

21:57.440 --> 22:04.560
and I think he also felt that he ultimately would end up in the Russians own right which he did

22:04.560 --> 22:10.160
right because it had been partitioned but it hadn't been announced that this area he was in

22:10.160 --> 22:14.880
would be in the right so maybe he just won't save it or see that somebody got it that would

22:14.880 --> 22:21.040
treasure it right and right so that's briefly it that's obviously a piece of history that you have

22:21.600 --> 22:27.600
that you that you treasure let's move on what I'm holding up here talk about this this helmet

22:27.600 --> 22:34.000
and you can see right now that the detail the intricacy of what we're showing here this is talk

22:34.000 --> 22:39.040
about this helmet and the barren gave you this right yes that's the spike helmet that German

22:39.040 --> 22:45.920
officers wore up through and including World War One now I presume this had belonged to someone

22:46.000 --> 22:53.200
in his family right because he had it and that's the old that was made the there's a

22:56.080 --> 23:04.160
turn around so it says inside that was made in September of 199 wow that was the day of

23:04.160 --> 23:13.040
manufacture wow that is incredible I've got to hold up a couple other things you just keep these

23:13.040 --> 23:18.640
things in your home is that right I've given them all to my son I see but he keeps them yes yeah

23:18.640 --> 23:25.520
I see I see you can take that off of the if you want to this what we're about to get a close-up

23:25.520 --> 23:33.600
on here is a is a German Luger that here we go now this didn't come from the barren tell me how

23:33.600 --> 23:42.160
you came by this that was on the on a German lieutenant colonel up on the Elb River one day

23:42.160 --> 23:48.560
who was standing or directing his troops cross right and I didn't have a good Luger and I figured

23:48.560 --> 23:56.320
that might be good so he gave it to me after I had asked him for it this is quite a quite a piece

23:56.320 --> 24:06.720
how long were you overseas all together almost a year I'm going to reach over here and got some

24:06.880 --> 24:16.000
other things this is a helmet another item that was given to you by the barren sort of we're

24:16.000 --> 24:23.200
going to get a get focused in on this and here we go there's a close-up of the swastika on the

24:23.200 --> 24:29.200
side of it and we will pan out talk about this helmet he gave this to you this belong to him I guess

24:30.080 --> 24:39.600
I don't know but that's where it was yes people see these in in movies and documentaries about

24:39.600 --> 24:48.480
World War II is find it incredible that that I'm actually holding one and on the other side there's

24:49.440 --> 24:56.080
there's another insignia here I'm going to go ahead and move here into the shot and here if we have

24:57.040 --> 25:04.000
another chance as I'm putting these up this is a I'm going to let you sort of describe this what

25:04.000 --> 25:11.520
are what am I holding here it's an SS dress dagger the SS troops used them I don't have the

25:11.520 --> 25:21.920
scabbard for it I don't never did but it was a part of a dress uniform right incredible and on

25:21.920 --> 25:27.680
the I can't read the German but there is a you have you know what it says here on the blade I'm

25:27.680 --> 25:33.200

25:33.200 --> 25:41.200
Germany I'll us fear Deutschland mm-hmm all for Germany right there's eagle on the on the handle has a

25:41.200 --> 25:50.000
a small swastika there one other item that folks will definitely recognize this is I guess this

25:50.000 --> 26:00.480
was given to you by the Baron this is a authentic Nazi arm band and the Baron gave you this

26:01.120 --> 26:08.800
there right so this is the the one that he wore good be yeah wow

26:11.840 --> 26:17.360
when you think about the war and you think about Hitler and and and what he stood for and what we

26:17.360 --> 26:23.360
were fighting against and all that you look at these as just artifacts of of sort of the memory

26:23.360 --> 26:28.480
of the victory of the allies and when you personally look at these things and look at what they

26:28.480 --> 26:33.280
they represent and the other side what are sort of the thoughts that that come to mind as a

26:33.280 --> 26:40.080
as a person who fought the war well now it's been so long I can do it dispassionately mm-hmm

26:40.160 --> 26:49.600
but for a long time I was wrapped up in the emotions of the whole thing because it's an experience that

26:51.280 --> 26:58.000
once you go through right and mine was not nearly as bad as a lot of people mm-hmm but because I

26:58.000 --> 27:04.080
