00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I'm going to play the piano.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
I'm Tom Turboville.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Last week you met Lieutenant General P.K. Carlton

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
and heard the incredible story of how what he hoped was going to be a career

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
as an Air Force pilot.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Became instead a career of perhaps even grander service

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
as a medical surgeon who helped create and implement a vision

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
for landmark breakthroughs in the care and survival of military men and women

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
who have in the past are now and will certainly in the future

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
put themselves in harm's way in defense of our country.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
We will continue today to hear those stories.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
But for most of this 30 minutes, General Carlton will talk about three Navy men,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Craig Powell, Dave Tarantino, and Dave Thomas.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And about a span of 19 minutes when their four paths met

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
at the Spotted Terrace, flew American Flight 77 into the Pentagon,

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
11 September 2001.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Please welcome back to Veterans of the Valley, Lieutenant General P.K. Carlton,

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
who since 2002 has served as director of Homeland Security for the Texas A&M Health Science Center.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
General Carlton, welcome back.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
It was a fascinating visit that we had last week.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
And I want to pick up sort of where we left off.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
You have been a medical doctor most of your career after a failed flight physical

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
said that you could not be a pilot back when you were at the Air Force Academy.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
And you decided to become a doctor and that's where your path has taken you.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
Talk about in 1999 when you became the 17th Surgeon General of the United States Air Force.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
How did your path get there?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
And what was your job in Washington at bowling Air Force Base

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
which right across the street from the Pentagon?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Yes, the Surgeon General of the Air Force is the chief doc for the Air Force,

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
is the way to think about it.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Right.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Is in charge of organizing and training and equipping.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
And so as we look at how the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, each of us does it a little bit differently,

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
but basically the same, it's how do we present our forces?

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
My forces indeed were the medical forces that then would support the line of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
And my particular part of the Air was air evacuation.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Right.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
And so that was my job.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
It also involved how do we do peace-time health care, how do we balance a budget, how do we interact with the Congress,

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
a whole variety of other things, but it was to look around the corners for what's coming in the future,

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
how can we prepare for them, and then to execute the medical program for 79 different facilities,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
which we had throughout the United States and overseas at that time.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Right.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
You told me at one time, when we were visiting that back in the 90s, there were people that were saying,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
hey, you know, we're not going to need this, we're not going to go to war again.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
And then in 2001, 2002, that all changed, of course.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
And in February of 2001, February of 2001, we're talking now.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
I want you to talk about a discussion that you were having with a colleague in the Pentagon.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And the discussion came to mind.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
And this goes back to what we were talking about last week about how you described your job as looking around corners,

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
conceiving of the inconceivable.

03:46.000 --> 03:54.000
And sort of how that relates to just sort of the happenstance conversation, how it came about one day in February of 2001.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Well, I was walking from one place to another, and the clinic commander,

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
where the Pentagon Clinic came up to me and said, we've got to do an exercise.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
And he started to describe what his plans were, and then he had to be quiet,

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
because we had an airplane go overhead, and we couldn't hear each other.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
And he looked at me and said, well, why don't we just do an airplane, hits the Pentagon?

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Loses an engine on takeoff from Ronald Reagan, the North airport.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Takes a bunch of birds, it's not a far out scenario.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
And crashes with a minimal controllable airspeed into the Pentagon, medics you're up.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I said, I'll buy. Please do.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
And so that exercise we accomplished in May, we did it as a tabletop, we had pictures of it.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
The airplane came to rest in the Cingric Court yard, and we learned a number of lessons.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
We, number one, didn't evacuate well, we didn't have a good evacuation plan.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
We didn't have evacuation plans for our special needs people.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
We didn't have equipment, we didn't have training.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
We didn't have a variety of things that we needed for our medical teams that we thought we should need.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
And we decided that our get well date would be one September.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Right.

04:57.000 --> 05:06.000
So when the event occurred on 11 September, I was in my boss's office, the vice chief staff,

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
and went down to the clinic to pick up a medical team thinking that the toughest place to be

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
would be in the Cingric Court yard because you couldn't get out.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
And as I grabbed a protective vest to put on, the young man beside me said,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
General, why are you making us do this again?

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Now you don't normally get challenged by a two striper at a three star level,

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
but I responded to him and he said, well, I'm not making you do it again.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Did you learn something last time?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
He said, yeah, I know how to handle this.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
I said great, and stick like glue to me, because this is the real thing.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Take a deep breath. That's real smoke.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
This is for real.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
And in fact, that young man put me out when I caught on fire.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I want to back up just a second.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
You arrived to work that day.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
You get your figure to be a normal day of work.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
You had your list of things to do, what you were going to accomplish that day.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
And I think you said that you were in a meeting of some sort at the time,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
when somebody turned on the television.

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
And you said that immediately you knew where most of the country, most of the media,

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
when the first plane hit the first tower in New York, that the people in that room knew

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
that that was not a system that had accidentally hit the World Trade Center.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
You knew more than that.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Yes. In that room, which was the chief of staff, the vice chief,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
all of the senior Air Force people in the Washington DC area,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
it was very obvious that was no accident.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
That was not an navigational error.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Yes.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
And that we had a real problem.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
They did not interrupt the meeting immediately, but instead waited a couple of minutes,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
and so literally we watched that one, the first impact,

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
and then real footage came through the show, the second impact on the second tower.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Exactly.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
And so at that point, our boss said, General Manor at War,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
and it was very apparent that we had a problem.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Right.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Indeed.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
You were on the other side of the Pentagon, from the impact area,

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
but you knew immediately because you said that you could feel the vibration,

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
you could feel the shutter.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Yes.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And the smoke was coming through the air conditioning system.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Yes.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
On the opposite side of the Pentagon, more than a half a mile away,

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
the Pentagon shook from the impact, and the smoke spread immediately.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
And so we knew we had a problem.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Right.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Take it from there.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
You went to the center of the courtyard with the team, reported to the fire chief.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
I'm ready to accept casualties, because as your job,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
you're in charge of medicine for the Air Force.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Take it from there.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
You gathered four guys together, they got letters, and you headed to where?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yes.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Well, the job in who's in charge becomes extremely important.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
And fire is always in charge.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Right.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Because they have the best situation awareness of what's going on in any given activity.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
So I reported into the fire chief and said, I'm ready to receive casualties.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
How can I help you?

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
And just as this fire chief started explaining to me, he didn't know where they were.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
A young text sergeant came out of the door, standing next to the fire chief,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
and said, you want to see where the die is, come with me.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
We can maybe save some.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
So I grabbed the four people closest to me, volunteered them to get a letter.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
And took a letter team then down the four corridor.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
And the Pentagon is a complex structure, five individual buildings,

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
each of a shape of a Pentagon, a five-sided building, five rings.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Connected by corridors, one through twelve.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
So we went down the four corridor, which happened to the ABCD and the,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
because you're going to be saying some letters here in a moment.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yes.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
And I want people to, most people have seen the aerial view of the Pentagon.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
They know what it looks like.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
But it's five rings from the inside out, ABCD and E.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
That is correct.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Go ahead.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
A is the center, and E is the outer, or the view lots, if you will.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
So we headed down the four corridor, went through ABC.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
And when we penetrated the D circle, or the D ring,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
it was on fire.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
The airplane had impacted between four and five corridors.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
And so we could not proceed on into the D ring, came out of D,

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
and there was an alleyway there called the AE corridor, came into that area.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
And as soon as we could see, the first thing I saw was a woman that was airborne

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
that had jumped off one of the upper stories, turned out it was the fifth story.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
Trying to get away from the fire, the fires of terrifying thing.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
And this huge man caught her.

09:31.000 --> 09:39.000
And when he caught her and understand even in this woman was probably a slight woman, a hundred, ten hundred and twenty pound,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
still knocked him right on his case, he was flat.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
But as he's laying on his back, another woman jumps out the same window.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
And he had the presence of mine to turn turtle, and hit her just as hard as he could,

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
as she went by, which gave her horizontal vector instead of a vertical vector.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Unfortunately, it also gave him a face plan.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
So he impacted his face on the concrete side wall that was there.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Popped right up, came to me and said, Sir, am I glad you're here?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Soluted and reported in.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
And I thought, Oh man, I'm not in Kansas anymore.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
This is no uniform on.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
He was not officially clocked in, even at that time.

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
I guess he was going to, he went into wherever their lockers are to put on his uniform because he was in shorts and a tank top.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
He was in shorts and a tank top.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
He was very obviously a physical specimen, even with a bloody face.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Very obviously a physical specimen turned out he was a Navy seal.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Navy seal, Craig Powell.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Craig Powell.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yes.

10:36.000 --> 10:44.000
He reported in and said, Sir, I heard screaming right in this area and he pointed to a hole from which fire was coming out.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
And headed to Bripile that went up to about six or seven feet.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
And the fire came jetting out across to the opposite wall and then bounced up into the air.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
He said, we've got to go in that hole.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I think we can get some more survivors.

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
What was the size of the hole because it turned out as you found out later that the hole was created by the landing gear.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
Yes. The hole was created by the landing gear and actually the landing gear was on fire just beyond where he was standing.

11:09.000 --> 11:15.000
And so we're standing in the shadow of the hole and it's probably 12 by 12 feet.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
I couldn't quite reach the top.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Right.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Couldn't side to side reach either side.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
We're going to see a photograph of it in a moment.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
But I want you to describe this.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Yes.

11:23.000 --> 11:30.000
As he's describing this, I've heard people scream as recently as five minutes ago to other people came from the adjacent corridor,

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
or the five corridor and burrowed right through the debris pile into that hole.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
Well, at that point, there's not a question of their life people and we just saw it go in.

11:40.000 --> 11:53.000
So we formed a line to follow in behind them and pass the debris that they were passing out at that time so that we could gain entrance into this as it turns out it's the Navy Com Center, the communication center.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Right.

11:54.000 --> 12:04.000
Immediately inside, we were very fortunate to find two women that had collapsed from smoke inhalation and when we picked them up, they were all attached.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And so we passed them out.

12:06.000 --> 12:15.000
It was a rather surreal experience as I'm passing this woman out and understand you can't stand up, you can't crawl because there's fire all around.

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
So you're kind of in a hard squat as low as you can be because the lower you are means you can breathe.

12:21.000 --> 12:28.000
And this woman revived literally as I'm maybe two inches from her and probably I scared her to death.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
But these two women were very fortunate they had gone down fairly recently.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
And so just the hassle of passing them out revived them.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
It became very apparent to me that this was a very hostile place.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
The man in front of me went down from smoke inhalation.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
We passed him out.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
I went deeper into the building and found out that you just couldn't breathe at all.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
I came back out and said, I want you to strip.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
I need your t-shirt, your t-shirt, your t-shirt, so come.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
And we then had what t-shirts to breathe through.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
That really was my contribution in this discussion.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Passed those to the team members that were inside.

13:06.000 --> 13:13.000
And then I caught a glimpse of a gentleman with his, just his face.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
And remember you can't see very well.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
But the fire is a remarkable brightness and I saw him under three waterfalls.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
There was a waterfall of fire coming from the roof onto a bookcase.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
Then it ran down the bookcase, then waterfalls onto a table.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And he was immediately under the table.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
And then it went down the table and waterfalls off the end of the table.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
And so it was a very surreal experience.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
But all I could see was a face and I didn't know if he was connected to a body or not.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
So I hit him with a wet t-shirt.

13:43.000 --> 13:50.000
He shook about the time that the man in front of me tried to lift the table, could not.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
He pushed the fire out of the way, got on his back, did a leg press, and said, go get him.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
And so it was apparent at that time that Jerry Henson, who was a retired naval officer, was alive.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
A million at the time.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
And the man that was doing the leg lift is David Tarotino.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
David Tarotino happened to be a Navy physician.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Right, right.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
And he was along with Dave Thomas.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Yes.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
Those were the two that had penetrated the briefout.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
Dave Tarotino gave me about four inches to get at this man.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
I got at him, invited him in my most polite military voice to come my way.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
And he did about six, eight inches enough for me to get a hand on him.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
And then I could pull him out and we passed him out.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
Then I got under the table with my colleague that had done the leg press.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
The most concerning thing I had at that point was this table is going to collapse and catch my friend.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
And so I wedged a fire extinguisher under the table.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
He relaxed in the table, didn't come down.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
I got under the table with him and he said, there's more to the right.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
And let's see if we can still hear them.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
So we try to get everybody quiet.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
That was the noise level was increasing for reasons that we didn't understand.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
So we told everybody to be quiet.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
The noise level didn't go down.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
But as this is going on, people are passing me things.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
They pass me a fire extinguisher.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
They pass me a flashlight.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
They pass me a mask so that we could begin to breathe again.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
So I give those to Tarotino.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
And both of us then are trying to figure out how to put our mask on when we can't see.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
But in the very low levels with a flashlight, with a fire extinguisher and with a mask,

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
we have the potential to see, to breathe, and then to take effective action with the fire extinguishers.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
So we were, thought we were king of the hill.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
We told everybody to be quiet.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
And in fact, the noise got louder, which we didn't understand.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
And then I heard a voice that said, get out.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
And I left a man in charge, the man in shorts, that I had described to you.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Craig Palt.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Craig Palt.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Craig Palt.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I left him in charge outside.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
I told him to stay outside because he didn't have clothing in to go into a burning building.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
And unbeknownst to me, he had come in and evacuated our team that was to the left looking for more survivors.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
And then came back in again because he was, he was uncertain about why the noise level was increasing.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
He thought the building was collapsing.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
So he came to get us.

16:13.000 --> 16:20.000
And so as he came into the building, into the room with us, he, he felt with his hands to see what's overhead.

16:20.000 --> 16:28.000
We were in a wire enclosure, the ultimate insecurity is a, then a room within a room that is a solid wire enclosure.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
As he reached up to feel that, it wasn't hot as he described it.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
But the ceiling started to fall down.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
He could feel the impact.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
He then hit the big John pose and told us to get out.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Now.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
In a louder voice.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Well, the first one was not very loud.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
The second one was very loud, very imperative.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
And I heard him very clearly.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And it was a different octave level.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
It was a different urgency.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Yes.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
And so I thought, you know, I don't know what's going on.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
But I know I left somebody in charge.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Now they're telling me to get out.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
They know something.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
I don't know.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
And so I grabbed Tarotino and said, we're out of here.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
Pushed him towards what the direction we come, the hole.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
And then I followed him down that little rabbit path towards the hole.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
And all of a sudden, the guy behind me hit me hard.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
I hit Tarotino hard and we all ended up in a ball in a lake, if you will,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
the water that had accumulated in the A.E. quarter.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
It turns out that was the pressure wave from the building collapsing.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Yes.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
That focused in at the hole.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
And blew us all out at the same time.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Yeah.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
Could you describe that you, getting out on your own, you couldn't walk,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
you couldn't crawl, you were literally churning.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
Like you were trying to swim through the debris to get out.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Yes.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
So you needed help and that push of air.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
And you all out.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Yes.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Yeah.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
And like you said, Powell, who you referred to as Big John,

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
and I think that's good, you were concerned that you had lost your team,

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
your original team of those four who had brought the letters

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
who had gone off to the left, left, while you had gone straight in.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
But it turns out he had gone in and gotten them.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Yes.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
And again, in any major event, you see your part of the world

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
and you have some idea of what happened from your memory.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
But only when we got everybody together about two weeks later,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
did we really find out who was on first, who was on second,

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
found out that what had gone on.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
In fact, the second lady that he caught recovered,

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
I found out through my research, her name was Dr. Betty Maxwell,

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
who was worked there at the Pentagon.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
We've got pictures.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
And let's go to them right now.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
And this is the whole that we talked about.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
It was created by the landing gear.

18:47.000 --> 18:53.000
And everything that you just talked about, that was it.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Yes.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Now picture this.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
This is three days later.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Right.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Picture this.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
There's a jet of straight fire that comes off the top three feet

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
and hits the opposite wall.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
It's so strong.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
And there's about, at higher than I level, a debris pile right across this,

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
the debris pile is also on fire.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
So it was truly a vision of hell, if you will.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Let's move on.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
These are pictures that I guess a lot of people have seen over the last eight years,

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
but just a reminder of the destruction.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
And again, just to remind people, this is the section of the Pentagon that had just been renovated.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Right.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
And it included structural steel and water.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
And rebar, it had water where the Pentagon was not built that way.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
And as you had told me as a matter of fact, that it actually hadn't been completed yet.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
And normally, if it had been completed, there'd have been 5,000 people there in that area.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
As it turned out, there were only a couple of hundred there, lost 125 of them.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
But if there was any silver lining there is that there are not as many people

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
that could have been there at the time.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
That's correct.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Let's move on.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
This is an animation.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Talk about what we're looking at there.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
What you're seeing is an animation of the Boeing 757, as it comes across,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
just about to hit the building.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
He has hit several light poles, one of which set his right engine on fire.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
This shows you the diagrammatic picture.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
He's in a little bit of a left hand bank.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
By speed criteria, he's going 460 knots at this particular point.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
And so this gives you a God's eye view to think about then the next picture,

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
which is an actual photograph of the impact sequence.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
On the right, what you see approaching aircraft is actually the smoke tail.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
You can see the nose of the aircraft just in front of that meter,

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
that is a parking meter, and you can see the tail just to the right and above the smoke line.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Now, one second later, you have the impact.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
You can see the airplane literally disintegrating as it penetrates the building

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
and as it literally explodes.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
This is from a security camera.

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
And people have seen these pictures before, but seeing them again, it's quite amazing.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
It's amazing.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
And pieces of the airplane were strewn all over the Pentagon grounds.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Right.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
Now, this shows you in red the major damage and in blue the minor damage.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
You can see it reflects the airplane exactly.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
Now, if you'll notice, the airplane isn't a little bit of a left hand bank.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
It follows the outline of the airplane exactly.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
And in the subsequent airplane or picture, we will show you a perfectly circle hole.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Right.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
That is right there.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
That is the right engine.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Yeah.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
If you look, if there's four arrows at the bottom of this picture,

21:40.000 --> 21:49.000
the far right arrow is sort of pointing up towards what you can see is an imprint of the exact hole,

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
which is the size and the shape of a jet engine.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
And that is where the right jet engine impacted into the building.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
You can see that circular impact.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Incredible.

22:04.000 --> 22:13.000
This is after the collapse.

22:13.000 --> 22:20.000
A aerial view of the collapse of the Pentagon.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
These are the people that we spoke about.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
On the left is Navy officer David Tarantino.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
On the right is David Thomas.

22:30.000 --> 22:38.000
And Mr. Henson, the man that the three of you helped save is in the middle.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Yes, these became very good friends.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Dave Tarantino remains an active duty physician.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
I put him in for the Medal of Honor from the American Medical Association.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
And he was awarded that about a year later.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Right.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
David Thomas has now been promoted to rear admiral and is the commander in Guantanamo Bay.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Right.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
And Jerry Henson actually spent two days in the hospital but had no major injuries.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Incredible.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Incredible.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Absolutely incredible.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Absolutely incredible.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
What you're describing took about 19 minutes and as I wrote on my notes here,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
your day wasn't over.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
This is still a working day for you.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Yes.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
Your job was to, what you prepared for all your career was times like this.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
To anticipate the unimaginable.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
So you still had work to do.

23:23.000 --> 23:33.000
So you, one thing I thought is that you're, your staff who had been kicked out of the Pentagon because of the security.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Was actually at your home.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Is that right?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Yes.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
When you showed up at your home, they thought you were dead because you were reported four hours missing.

23:42.000 --> 23:53.000
And your executive had reported that he had dropped you off to take an identification picture right at the point where the impact happened earlier in the morning at 9.30.

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
And, but luckily the picture was taken early and you were out of there by then.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Yes.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
But your staff thought you were dead.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Yes.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Yeah.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
It actually was a little bit funny.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
The staff's all there and I came upstairs.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
I was a mess and you certainly don't give a briefing to your boss when you're a mess.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
So my desire was to get an impression of form.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
And all I saw was a bunch of jaws dropping people's faces turned white.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
And they made a joke.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Hey, come on.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
What do you guys think you mump off the three-starrier?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Everybody gets a promotion?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Come on.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
We got work to do.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
And in fact, I didn't realize that they'd been told that.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
And fortunately, they hadn't told my wife.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
So she wasn't so alarmed.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
They gave me a kiss at the room and said, go get cleaned up.

24:32.000 --> 24:40.000
You found out that you all were your duty as far as for immediate response was not needed in Washington.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Hospitals had it under control.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
So your attention went to New York City.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
And it was decided.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
We've only got about three minutes left, unfortunately.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
But to launch a 400-beds of medical and surgical capability to New York City.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
And you had that done in 22 hours.

24:57.000 --> 25:05.000
Because you did not know at the time what was going to happen in New York and how many injuries that there would be in New York.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
But it became actually what turned out to be a great exercise.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
It wasn't needed once you got to New York because, unfortunately, the buildings collapsed.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
There were deaths instead of injuries.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
And New York had it under control.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Am I pretty much describing that?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
That is correct.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Yes, exactly.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Right.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
So we responded to New York City.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
We briefed our bosses.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
We are the air force.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
And so air assets are readily available.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
And we were the lightest assets to respond.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
We had tried to contact New York City to find out did they need help.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
And I had been working with both Washington Hospital Center and New York City on mass casualties.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
And how do you plan for them?

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
And so not being able to get a hold of them concerned me.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
And so we launched our fleet.

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
And in less than 24 hours, we had those 400-beds of medical and surgical capability at an air base right outside New York City.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Called McGuire Air Force Base.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
As it turns out, we weren't needed.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
We came back.

26:03.000 --> 26:10.000
But only for a short time because those same people deployed immediately in support of the ongoing war that occurred in Afghanistan.

26:10.000 --> 26:16.000
In a minute and a half, can you describe your job as director of Homeland Security at the Health Science Center?

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Yes.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I am very privileged to work for Dr. Nancy Dickie.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
She has asked me to do the same thing I did in the military.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
And that is look around corners.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
And figure out how can we prepare our state better, how can we prepare our nation better.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
What are the ongoing issues and come back casually care that I was involved with for so long?

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
And that is really what I do here.

26:37.000 --> 26:43.000
The highlight of that was 2005 when we had an opportunity stand up at contingency hospital in our large annual hospital.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
And we took care of 650 people that had been evacuated for Hurricane Rita.

26:49.000 --> 26:57.000
And so the same things that I have worked on throughout my whole career now apply to us today as we work a whole variety of different ways.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Both at the state and at the national level.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
So that is what she has asked me to do.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
That is what I have continued to do.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
And I absolutely love it.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
And you have been here since 2002.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
You came here right about a month before you officially retired from the United States Air Force.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
That is correct.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
It has been an incredible two episodes and we thank you for your service.

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
And thank you for just an incredible story and what you continue to do for our country and our university.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Well thank you.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
It is a real privilege.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
All right. Thank you General.

27:25.000 --> 27:32.000
Over the last two veterans of the valleys we have tried to capture the essence of this fascinating career of Lieutenant General P.K. Carlton.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
In fact, it would take many, many hours to tell the whole story.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
General Carlton and his wife Jan have four grown children.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
We thank him and salute him for his service.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I am Tom Turby-Vale.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Thank you.
