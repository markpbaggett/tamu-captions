00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
Today is a day to commemorate and a day to salute.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.580
We commemorate the magnificent Challenger 7,

00:07.580 --> 00:09.980
when we lost last year at this time.

00:09.980 --> 00:13.980
And we salute you, the men and women of America's NASA team.

00:13.980 --> 00:17.020
America will never forget that terrible moment a year ago

00:17.020 --> 00:21.520
when our relation turned to horror and then to grief and pain.

00:21.520 --> 00:26.100
Seven of our final words for the boundaries of space,

00:26.100 --> 00:29.540
where Earth ends and the path to the stars begins.

00:29.540 --> 00:33.880
In the next decade, we will build and fly a new space shuttle.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.940
For me, this is a special commitment.

00:36.940 --> 00:39.240
In the first moments of grief and shock,

00:39.240 --> 00:41.680
the bereaved families of the crew, Earth.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.960
Program moving forward.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.200
We owe it to them and to those whom we too lost,

00:52.200 --> 00:54.160
they do just that.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.600
Now, I know that voices have been raised from time to time,

00:57.600 --> 01:00.840
saying, oh yes, it's exciting and adventurous.

01:00.840 --> 01:05.080
But does it have any practical value to justify its cost?

01:05.080 --> 01:09.240
Well, the answer to that question is a resounding yes.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.360
Perhaps we've been derelict and not doing more

01:11.360 --> 01:14.480
to make known the literally thousands of human oriented

01:14.480 --> 01:18.720
technological developments that have spun off from the program,

01:18.720 --> 01:21.040
and which will affect all our lives,

01:21.040 --> 01:25.440
and the lives of our children and our children's children.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.120
But there's every reason to believe these spin-offs

01:28.120 --> 01:31.040
will become a tremendous value.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.560
I understand that a project is now being developed

01:33.560 --> 01:37.000
to pass on to all Americans specific knowledge

01:37.000 --> 01:39.640
of this aspect of the space program.

01:39.640 --> 01:43.480
The United States Space Foundation, a nonprofit educational

01:43.480 --> 01:47.600
foundation, is preparing a series of TV and radio

01:47.600 --> 01:51.160
public service statements so that all Americans

01:51.160 --> 01:53.520
will be aware of these achievements

01:53.520 --> 01:58.040
and how they will benefit all of our lives.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.840
I think this is a worthy effort.

02:00.840 --> 02:03.560
Yes, whether it's in the exploration of space

02:03.560 --> 02:07.040
or the applications of space research here at home,

02:07.040 --> 02:10.320
the future to which you are leading this is bright.

02:10.320 --> 02:13.680
The challenge that you're shouldering for all mankind

02:13.680 --> 02:16.840
is one that we cannot turn away from.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.200
We owe it to our children and their children

02:19.200 --> 02:21.360
and generations beyond.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.360
We owe it to ourselves.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.040
We owe it to those who with all their love and joy

02:26.040 --> 02:30.400
encourage, pass again just one year ago today.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.760
But mankind you reach must exceed its grasp

02:34.760 --> 02:37.120
for what's ahead and for.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.120
The story is agreed at a strife

02:50.120 --> 02:53.920
that the study of space is the oldest of the physical sciences.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.120
It has captured the attention of philosophers and farmers,

02:57.120 --> 02:59.400
lovers and lawyers, virtually everyone

02:59.400 --> 03:01.880
who shares this relationship, we call it.

03:07.880 --> 03:11.560
On the walls of kings in the mythology of the earliest times,

03:11.560 --> 03:16.560
the globe, we understand the nature of the universe,

03:16.560 --> 03:18.760
creating models from his observations.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.720
He was able to solve challengers,ungenessâ€”

03:21.720 --> 03:24.880
I just wanted to ask you what the world is.

03:54.880 --> 03:59.680
our reach into space, man's understanding accelerated.

03:59.680 --> 04:04.880
And then something very special happened.
