00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
Accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brasislavali citizens.

00:04.760 --> 00:07.000
First National Bank, first always.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.600
Hello and welcome to Veteran to the Valley.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.560
I'm Tom Terbivill.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.840
Cal Boykin was born in New Mexico.

00:42.840 --> 00:46.600
He grew up in Big Spring, Aggie Class of 1946.

00:46.600 --> 00:52.200
But like many, his actual graduation came after his World War II service as a proud member

00:52.200 --> 00:57.920
of the 814th Tank Destroyer Battalion following Patton's Third Army through France and Belgium

00:57.920 --> 00:58.920
and Holland.

00:58.920 --> 01:03.280
Today we continue our visit with Sergeant Cal Boykin of College Station.

01:03.280 --> 01:07.080
Cal is wonderful to have you back and just sort of by review for the people who might have

01:07.080 --> 01:11.240
missed last week and I'm sorry that they did 814th Tank Battalion.

01:11.240 --> 01:14.680
Again you grew up in Big Spring, you went to ANM, you went into the service, you thought

01:14.680 --> 01:18.840
you were going to be in the air corps but that got changed and you had your training

01:18.840 --> 01:22.080
at Camp Hood and also at Camp Oak.

01:22.080 --> 01:26.280
Talk just a little bit about the Tank Battallions, what they were and sort of what your missions

01:26.280 --> 01:27.280
were.

01:27.280 --> 01:32.960
They were really Tank Destroyer Battallions and they looked like tanks and if you watch

01:32.960 --> 01:38.480
any documentary about a third of those that you see or tank destroyer rather than tanks.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.480
Right.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.480
Right.

01:40.480 --> 01:49.680
So we've often said if we had a coaxial camera there showing the rounds where we would

01:49.680 --> 01:55.280
knock out a tank that would be more popular than the 8th Air Force.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.880
It didn't work out.

01:57.880 --> 01:58.880
Exactly.

01:58.880 --> 02:07.720
But anyway we were to destroy tanks, the Doctor and Caller for Solid, being reserved and

02:07.720 --> 02:15.320
move up and hit that big task force, a big frontal attack by all these heavy tanks.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.280
But it didn't work out that way.

02:17.280 --> 02:24.320
The Germans began to use fewer tanks, they had fewer tanks and they used combined arms,

02:24.320 --> 02:31.440
infantry and artillery and tanks and then air if they had it.

02:31.440 --> 02:36.880
So we had to be integrated into infantry divisions or armored divisions.

02:36.880 --> 02:42.480
In our case we were integrated into the 7th armored division after we landed in France.

02:42.480 --> 02:47.200
We talked last week about that you went over to England, you were trained at Packington Park

02:47.200 --> 02:53.240
and then you went over landed at Utah Beach Normandy about two months after D-Day.

02:54.240 --> 02:58.880
Take us from there and your push it was a rather quick push because you were following

02:58.880 --> 03:03.880
Patten and he was always in a hurry and you pushed through France and Holland and Belgium

03:03.880 --> 03:05.640
and on the Indian Germany.

03:05.640 --> 03:12.600
Well in fact we went through the old World War I battlefields.

03:12.600 --> 03:23.120
Our division took Chateau Therry for done until we ran out of gas, out ran the supply.

03:24.120 --> 03:31.200
So we had enough diesel for our M10s that is our tank destroyers but we couldn't go

03:31.200 --> 03:33.680
into the loan.

03:33.680 --> 03:38.840
So we had this rest just for a little while and this is when a truck showed up and took

03:38.840 --> 03:46.920
us over to one of the cemetery at Saint Mehill, American cemetery from World War I.

03:46.920 --> 03:53.600
We visited and viewed it almost and it was kept just like you see it today probably,

03:53.600 --> 03:57.680
you know, nicely mowed and green and all that.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.680
Right.

03:58.680 --> 04:04.680
And then we visited a trench of bayonets with a trench that cave down on these French emperors

04:04.680 --> 04:08.320
before they went over the top and the bayonets still stick there.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.320
Wow.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.120
Now I didn't see that person but others in my group did.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.120
I didn't see that.

04:14.120 --> 04:21.760
You were a sergeant on an M8 armored car, a 37 millimeter gun, 30 caliber machine gun.

04:21.760 --> 04:29.000
I want to go to August the 18th I believe it was and a task force mission that you told

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
me about.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Talk about that.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.120
Well we were a combat command A of the 7th armored order desk forward to take Rambole.

04:38.120 --> 04:43.320
Now there was another college station man turned out later, Colonel Vernon Files.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.600
He was a lieutenant.

04:44.600 --> 04:49.080
He took another task force but we went on the right hand side and he went on the left

04:49.080 --> 04:55.080
hand side and the big wall surrounding the Rambole castle, the summer home of the French

04:55.080 --> 04:56.080
presidents, you know.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.080
Right.

04:57.080 --> 05:02.520
We never saw the castle because we were worried what happened because some of the cavalrymen

05:02.520 --> 05:08.280
had been ambushed there the day before and a number of were killed.

05:08.280 --> 05:13.400
And one of the cavalrymen hollered up to us, what's that 88?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.880
And sure enough it's firing.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.480
Mr. Spy inches hit the wall.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.960
We backed into the wall.

05:20.960 --> 05:25.360
Of course I was trying to get to see where it is, where is that gun?

05:25.360 --> 05:27.880
It fired again and I saw it.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.440
That I don't think was 88.

05:30.440 --> 05:35.320
Everybody thought all guns were 88s but it was probably 75 maybe.

05:35.320 --> 05:44.080
But it just traveled like a torpedo across that dusty fellow field and came right underneath

05:44.080 --> 05:47.240
us and went out through the wall.

05:47.240 --> 05:55.360
Well I took aim and back ready to fire and Marvin Moser, the driver of Lieutenant Fukers

05:55.360 --> 06:01.600
just ahead of mine, came back and he was in the site so I had to pull back and by that

06:01.600 --> 06:08.840
time I'd lost any way of being accurate so I just fired.

06:08.840 --> 06:15.840
And of course the arm repeating shell with a tracer you can see about 30 feet over.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.080
But at least it gave us time to get out the line of fire.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.760
They fired a couple more times but they were wild.

06:22.760 --> 06:27.920
And I went back there, Rosemary and I did, 97.

06:28.920 --> 06:34.360
And there was an American Eagle monument to all the soldiers who were killed.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.560
I think there were nine and all at that ambush.

06:37.560 --> 06:45.280
And one was a pilot and I had seen that P-47 Thunderbolt go down.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.200
Flames coming out of the cow like I can see the pilot in just a clear day.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.760
He seemed to be unconscious and it crashed.

06:52.760 --> 07:00.040
Well the French took care of the body until the grave registration people could show.

07:00.040 --> 07:08.320
Francois, Rosemary history of liberation of Rampilae and she managed to get people to

07:08.320 --> 07:15.080
come and for one of the ceremonies they have two or a year, one on D-Day and one on

07:15.080 --> 07:18.560
Liberation Day of Rampilae.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.920
And then included in that group was a sister at the pilot who was playing and I had seen

07:22.920 --> 07:24.760
go down.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.880
And later on she was ill and oil.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.480
She was down in the valley for the winter.

07:29.480 --> 07:36.920
She and her husband and I visited and we had quite a little session.

07:36.920 --> 07:42.040
I was the first person she had talked to who had members seeing the playing go down.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.040
Wow.

07:43.040 --> 07:47.440
And if there was any consolation all I could say was I think he'd ever do you what happened

07:47.440 --> 07:48.440
for me.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.680
He was probably important for her to know.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.680
That must have been an amazing experience for her to meet you.

07:54.680 --> 07:55.680
Indeed.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.640
But there are a lot of quenchedness in this business.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.160
Indeed there is.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.400
I want to tell you what we're going to do right now.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.760
I want to go to some photographs right now because I've got a lot more than I want to

08:07.760 --> 08:11.360
talk to you about your service.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.720
But I want to go to some photographs.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.480
Some of the ones we saw last week so this will be by review and we'll go ahead and go

08:16.480 --> 08:17.480
to those right now.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.480
We saw this one last week.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.600
We'll do it again for people who didn't see the show last week.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.000
This was taken at Camp Hood.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Is that right?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Right.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Norah Camp Hood.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Right.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.720
And that's the patch of your unit.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.800
The seven means attached to the seventh armoured division.

08:32.800 --> 08:33.800
Right.

08:33.800 --> 08:34.800
Okay.

08:34.800 --> 08:35.800
Let's move on to the next photograph.

08:35.800 --> 08:38.640
That was in Belgium near Spav.

08:38.640 --> 08:43.880
Right after I got out of the field hospital with a hand infection.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.200
Right hand was pretty bad shape.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
Right.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.840
And this was the kind of weather that you hear people talk about at the Battle of the

08:50.840 --> 08:51.840
Bulge.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.840
Right.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.440
And this was the kind of snow that was it.

08:54.440 --> 08:55.840
And this was like in February.

08:55.840 --> 08:56.840
Right here.

08:56.840 --> 08:57.840
Okay.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.360
Let's move on.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.560
This was the book that we talked about last week.

09:01.560 --> 09:07.400
The book about tanks where that is actually a replacement tank that you found yourself on.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.400
You're in that picture.

09:08.400 --> 09:13.080
You're there in the top turret with the helmet sort of looking at the camera.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.000
And you didn't even know this picture had been taken until it showed up on the cover of

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
the book.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Right.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.400
Well, we were looking pretty serious and pretty cold.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.400
Exactly.

09:21.400 --> 09:27.680
But that we were on a recon mission and probably one of the first after we had pulled out

09:27.680 --> 09:29.560
of St. Vic.

09:29.560 --> 09:36.680
St. Vith was the major stumbling block that the Germans had to get over if they could.

09:36.680 --> 09:41.160
And anyway, we of Task Force Jones, we came out.

09:41.160 --> 09:46.600
I lost my armored car in the crash of the ice.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.000
And we were trying to set it on fire.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
It didn't work.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.680
And the German tank came up and finished the job and we left.

09:52.680 --> 09:56.400
Let's move on to the next picture because here's some new.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.480
Will Rogers Jr. was a member of the 814th.

09:59.480 --> 10:04.320
He was the same unit that you were in.

10:04.320 --> 10:08.160
And talk about him because he is somebody that you profile in your book.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.480
This is the son of the great American humorous Will Rogers.

10:11.480 --> 10:15.840
Well, of course, he earlier had been elected to Congress.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.040
He had been in the Army, had a commission.

10:18.040 --> 10:22.600
He was serving, I think, at Camp Hood in the training center.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.200
But he was elected.

10:25.200 --> 10:29.080
And then he resigned his commission, went into Congress.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.920
Now Congress, he worked on the soldiers' voting bill.

10:32.920 --> 10:39.040
And then he did some other things about trying to bring the Jews of Eastern Europe into

10:39.040 --> 10:41.760
the US using Jewish money.

10:41.760 --> 10:45.040
And those two bills completely failed.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.320
And it didn't have the support from the State Department.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.720
I don't know what all.

10:48.720 --> 10:53.660
But anyway, he was demoralized, I gather, because that was when he resigned his seat in

10:53.660 --> 10:54.660
Congress.

10:54.660 --> 10:57.760
And joined us while we were in England.

10:57.760 --> 11:01.920
He joined the 814th Enricoan Company commanding the 1st of June.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.000
I was in the 2nd, but then.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.360
He later became an actor, as a matter of fact, played his father in many movies and also

11:08.360 --> 11:09.880
was in television.

11:09.880 --> 11:13.480
I'm old enough to remember him when he was in television.

11:13.480 --> 11:17.920
He's quite a resemblance to his dad, of course, also.

11:17.920 --> 11:18.920
Let's move on to the next picture.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.320
We'll talk more about Will Rogers later.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.800
This is a reunion picture.

11:22.800 --> 11:27.040
You are the 3rd from the right or 4th from the left, whichever way you want to count.

11:27.040 --> 11:31.120
And I will say that you are a larger man back then.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.120
I think so.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.440
You're looking quite trim right now.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.920
I'll tell you that.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.240
Talk about this reunion picture and where it was taken.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.720
Well, this was in Savannah, Missouri.

11:42.720 --> 11:49.280
And we didn't have reunion, it's up until about, oh, I guess, 18 years ago.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.640
And then we had one every year.

11:51.640 --> 11:57.120
And believe it or not, they were organized and formed.

11:57.120 --> 12:06.640
The addresses were found and what not, notifications by the second section sergeant, Carol Christmas.

12:06.640 --> 12:12.880
And I was the other sergeant of second, he held the reunions.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.480
I wrote the book.

12:14.480 --> 12:18.920
These two monkeys, we did our best for the 814.

12:18.920 --> 12:23.160
I know these were all great reunions.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.120
And these pictures are all in your book.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.120
Let's move on.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.000
I think we've got some more pictures.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.160
This is a picture that was taken at Camp Hood.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.160
When was this taken?

12:32.160 --> 12:34.400
And this is you standing in front of an M.A.

12:34.400 --> 12:35.400
Armored Car.

12:35.400 --> 12:39.400
Oh, this has been, oh, I guess, a number of years ago, probably 20 years ago.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.400
Right.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.720
It was the first Cavalry Museum, I believe.

12:43.720 --> 12:51.480
And the Tanker's Story Museum artifacts are in the 4th Infantry Museum now.

12:51.480 --> 12:59.480
And there are some vehicles, the M18, the M10 and the 2M10s.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.480
Right.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.800
That was your vehicle there.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.800
You knew everything about that.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.080
Here's you in Rosemary at one of the reunions.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.080
Where was that taken, do you recall?

13:11.080 --> 13:21.360
That would have been in 95, I believe, because that's when it broke the book to distribute

13:21.360 --> 13:22.360
it.

13:22.360 --> 13:26.120
When you wrote the book, Rosemary, your wife was 61 years.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.120
Right.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.600
Quite a career that she had also.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.560
We'll talk about her and your family a little bit later on.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.560
See if we have any more.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.560
Nope, that's it.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.560
That's all the photographs.

13:35.560 --> 13:39.240
I wanted to get those and get the people to see those because there are some other stories

13:39.240 --> 13:40.760
that I want you to tell.

13:40.760 --> 13:44.680
I want to make sure that you have time to tell this whole story because I think it's

13:44.680 --> 13:46.680
just a fascinating story.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.880
I want you to talk about, I'm just going to let you take it.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.880
I want you to talk about Annie and Theo.

13:51.880 --> 13:52.880
Okay.

13:52.880 --> 14:01.320
When we moved from Metz with the Third Army, we transferred up to Holland with the Ninth Army

14:01.320 --> 14:04.680
and then with the Second British Army.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.880
We were camped just outside of the Maustricht.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.880
The Maustricht is an old Roman city.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.520
It's probably the oldest city in the Holland.

14:12.520 --> 14:13.840
Right in and it's very south.

14:13.840 --> 14:17.080
Belgium, on the border, Germany over here.

14:17.080 --> 14:21.320
It's a little different part of Holland, but it's a fine city.

14:21.320 --> 14:27.000
We got word that they were going to, the girls, even the speaking girls of Maustricht, were

14:27.000 --> 14:30.880
going to hold a dance for Seventh Armored Boys.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.120
Well I went to the dance.

14:33.120 --> 14:38.720
Most of my petun and people on you were married and they didn't care about this sort of thing

14:38.720 --> 14:40.920
at that time.

14:40.920 --> 14:47.520
So I went and I visited last week that the whole, the Grand Theater, where where the dance

14:47.520 --> 14:48.520
was held.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.680
Mirrors on the wall, Shandle Leaves.

14:51.680 --> 14:56.840
I had washed my clothes in gasoline and getting ready to go and here I showed up in that

14:56.840 --> 15:01.480
environment it was completely different.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.120
And here was Annie and her blood dress and so on.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.000
I danced with her.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.880
Dance with her probably all evening and then she asked me to come and visit her.

15:10.880 --> 15:20.600
And her family, her family mother and father, two brothers and her father was a chef.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.800
I can relate to that being a hotel.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.040
And we had a lot of things to talk about.

15:26.040 --> 15:32.240
Her mother was German, but she talked to me constantly and made me understand what she

15:32.240 --> 15:33.240
wanted.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.920
She was a quite a lady.

15:35.920 --> 15:42.520
But I almost missed her because the way she gave 31, I thought it was 37, you know, how

15:42.520 --> 15:44.040
they make a one.

15:44.040 --> 15:48.360
And I almost missed her and a couple of GIs and said, well that's 31, not 37.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.240
So I went back and say, anyway, had the wrong address.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.760
And we visited quite a lot of them several times.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.960
I'd get to Leaves and then we were gone.

15:56.960 --> 16:02.720
And when we were called back down into the bulls on the 17th of December, why I thought

16:02.720 --> 16:07.160
we were going to go through Mastery, not bail out and go see anybody.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.840
But it didn't work out that way.

16:09.840 --> 16:18.200
But I did visit her a number of times because after the war, we were in occupation.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.080
The 7th Army went home.

16:20.080 --> 16:25.480
Hasbrook took his division home, left us in occupation.

16:25.480 --> 16:29.600
And I was taking a group to Brussels for on leave.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.920
We stopped at the railway station in Egypt.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.520
I looked, I said, come.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.480
I'll see you boys in Brussels.

16:35.480 --> 16:39.720
And so I have this with Annie.

16:39.720 --> 16:45.480
And then I've run a few of them with them a couple of days later or so.

16:45.480 --> 16:50.240
But she was engaged to Thiel Romans.

16:50.240 --> 16:53.520
This was Annie Sanders, Thiel Romans.

16:53.520 --> 17:01.840
She was an engineer, a safety engineer for the Dutch state mines in Hellen, just north.

17:01.840 --> 17:08.800
And we used to go up to Hellen for showers at least a couple of times in the mines.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.640
But I never met him.

17:10.640 --> 17:11.840
But he was an individual.

17:11.840 --> 17:13.560
He was talented.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.240
He played his guitar.

17:15.240 --> 17:19.920
He was there at the Liberation of Mastery on the 14th of September.

17:19.920 --> 17:20.920
Had American help with him.

17:20.920 --> 17:21.920
I had a picture.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.840
He's as is American hill.

17:23.840 --> 17:28.920
His twin sister is sitting there in a jeep with some GI.

17:28.920 --> 17:33.320
So you hadn't met him, but you had something in common.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.320
That was Annie.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.320
That's right.

17:35.320 --> 17:41.240
And he always reminded me, says, I want.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.360
But of course, I started telling you four on assignments.

17:44.360 --> 17:48.760
And when that happened, while we were able to come back through in 1970, we had our first

17:48.760 --> 17:53.160
visit with both Annie and Thiel.

17:53.160 --> 18:00.160
And it went well because we toured the Peele-Marsheri in Holland where we fought.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.160
And we toured our dens where we fought.

18:03.160 --> 18:11.600
The St.Vit, the Salam-Shattoe, where I lost my arm in the car and dealed with them.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.040
And I was there last week.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.640
And we laid a few rees and so on.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.640
It's interesting.

18:20.640 --> 18:24.800
Your daughter and emailed me this, talking about this.

18:24.800 --> 18:29.840
And she wrote, Theo knew of the attraction, but stayed in the background, also feeling

18:29.840 --> 18:32.400
a sense of debt to the soldiers.

18:32.400 --> 18:36.880
So although he knew of the attraction, it was...

18:36.880 --> 18:43.000
Well, see, Theo, when they close the mines down, he became the puppy's relations officer

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
for the city.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.560
Now, that's a pretty responsible job because the queen comes and he makes the arrangements.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.560
And then, as he said, the GI has come and they want to...

18:52.560 --> 18:54.560
Well, whatever happened to Helka.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.920
He says, well, Helka, I don't know, but she didn't know.

18:57.920 --> 19:02.160
He'd help face down these and then here comes Boykin.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.160
Where is Annie?

19:04.160 --> 19:05.160
Right.

19:05.160 --> 19:09.160
But anyway, he had a good sense he was.

19:09.160 --> 19:12.160
And this was all before you met Rosemary.

19:12.160 --> 19:18.160
And after you and Rosemary got married, the remarkable thing about this is that you

19:18.160 --> 19:19.160
all became friends.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.160
That's right.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.160
We stayed friends.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.160
We made couples.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.160
Right.

19:23.160 --> 19:29.160
Now, sadly, Theo passed away at 99 or two brothers that passed away and one son had.

19:29.160 --> 19:34.760
But talk about, before he passed away, what happened in 1989 involving the show Good Morning

19:34.760 --> 19:35.760
America?

19:35.760 --> 19:36.760
That's right.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.760
Good morning America show came to Holland.

19:39.760 --> 19:44.960
I don't know where else they were going, but they interviewed Captain with the 30th

19:44.960 --> 19:51.960
O'Hicks Resolution, which liberated Master and they interviewed Theo.

19:51.960 --> 19:59.000
Well, Theo, they would say, well, what a duveless time it was, everybody singing, dancing

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
and everything.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.960
But Theo, no, he looked so much to the trucks bringing the bodies to Margaret and Cemetery

20:05.960 --> 20:07.600
for burial.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.600
And he had a few things to say about that.

20:10.600 --> 20:14.600
And he was very serious about these things.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.400
And he said, infantrymen never smiled.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.720
He never saw.

20:18.720 --> 20:25.080
He said, these others, even yourself, you smile every day.

20:25.080 --> 20:37.040
And but one thing I might mention is in 1976, anyway, I'll continue this.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.800
They asked him, well, are you still in touch with Americans?

20:40.800 --> 20:41.800
Oh, yeah.

20:41.800 --> 20:48.200
Calvin Roosevelt Boykin, Colin station, Texas, 814, Texas.

20:48.200 --> 20:55.880
And we got a tape of that because by sudden Clay called Phoenix and they taped it over there

20:55.880 --> 20:58.800
because an hour later and we have a copy of it.

20:58.800 --> 20:59.800
Yeah.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.560
You and your wife are out of the country at the time of this, but your family had seen

21:02.560 --> 21:06.040
it because they were at your father's funeral in Austin at the time.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.040
That's right.

21:07.040 --> 21:12.240
They had seen it that day and the grandchildren were like, what are you talking about, Cal?

21:12.240 --> 21:15.040
I'm not, I'm not, Grandpa, I'm Cal.

21:15.040 --> 21:19.520
You know, that irritates some of our group.

21:19.520 --> 21:23.280
But they got to worry about it.

21:23.280 --> 21:31.640
The Bostrick boys would take a torch and run it for Normandy all the way to Bostrick on

21:31.640 --> 21:38.440
September the 14th, they would arrive and they would light that flame.

21:38.440 --> 21:46.920
And so in the 76, they flew to Washington, let that torch and ran it down to Washington,

21:46.920 --> 21:51.280
and they put it on the steps of the Capitol in honor of our bicentennial.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.280
Wow.

21:52.280 --> 21:53.280
Wow.

21:53.280 --> 21:58.480
And then the ethereal came, visited us, I picked him up in Houston.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.480
I took him to the San Jacinto Battlegrounds.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.800
I said, this is where the revolution was fought.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.800
Right.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.280
The real revolution.

22:05.280 --> 22:10.200
I want you to talk about after your service and you came back to the United States and

22:10.200 --> 22:18.160
your beautiful wife, Rosemary, because when you met her and how that developed in 61

22:18.160 --> 22:19.880
years you've been married now.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.640
I started back to the idea of it ranging from forestry.

22:23.640 --> 22:29.880
And I was sophomore Rosemary, senior at SMU.

22:29.880 --> 22:35.080
She was going to become a medical artist and she had combined things there in such a way

22:35.080 --> 22:37.160
that she could do that.

22:37.160 --> 22:42.480
And then she belonged to the sororities, she had a big function going on.

22:42.480 --> 22:51.280
My good friend in medical school, my good friend from Rochelle, his wife, his girlfriend,

22:51.280 --> 22:56.360
what would become his wife, but she was in medical school and a good friend of Rosemary's.

22:56.360 --> 23:02.280
And she insisted on both of them that we double date that night.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.320
That I'd be a blind date.

23:04.320 --> 23:11.320
Well, Rosemary's aunt came along and made sure this happened thanks to her Rosemary and

23:11.320 --> 23:12.320
I met.

23:12.320 --> 23:21.160
And we dated every weekend, I guess you could say, that sunbeam, I ought to have stock in

23:21.160 --> 23:22.160
that.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.160
Right.

23:23.160 --> 23:30.160
But we met in March, we married 30th of June.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.160
Wow.

23:31.160 --> 23:35.560
And then she helped me graduate.

23:35.560 --> 23:37.360
She worked for Oceanography Department.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.360
Right.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.360
And for several years.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.360
Evans Library, I think.

23:41.360 --> 23:42.360
And the library.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.360
And Spacecraft Oceanography.

23:44.360 --> 23:50.360
And as we mentioned, I believe in the last show, she's published her own history of

23:50.360 --> 23:51.360
Razzis Valley Italians.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.360
Right.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.360
That's right.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.360
In honor of her own heritage.

23:54.360 --> 23:55.360
Right.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.360
And their history of her family.

23:57.360 --> 24:08.560
And as she did a tape of all the ships that left Palermo, Sicily, with Italians landed

24:08.560 --> 24:09.560
in New Orleans.

24:09.560 --> 24:16.200
Now, all the Italians from here, practically, came, their predecessors came from New Orleans

24:16.200 --> 24:17.560
over here.

24:17.560 --> 24:21.040
And many of their names were owned, the ship's logs.

24:21.040 --> 24:25.440
Well, those may be recorded all of those, for out of RAM, any ships and for out of many

24:25.440 --> 24:27.520
years, but a lot of them.

24:27.520 --> 24:28.920
And put them on tape.

24:28.920 --> 24:29.920
All right.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.000
CD.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.600
And so she's been, they still say, birds of passage, she calls it.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.600
Birds of passage.

24:37.600 --> 24:38.600
Yeah.

24:38.600 --> 24:43.400
And you have four children, seven grandchildren and four great grandchildren.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.400
Right.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.480
And I know that you're proud of your whole family.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.480
That's right.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.560
It's been something.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.560
It has been.

24:50.560 --> 24:54.520
Your career, I wish we had a whole other show to talk about your post-military career,

24:54.520 --> 24:57.200
but obviously it involved a lot of travel.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.200
Right.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.200
For ten years, you all spent most of that ten years outside.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.200
Right.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.240
We were two years in Syria.

25:03.240 --> 25:10.320
And four years in Botswana, four years in Lissuti, both of those in southern Africa.

25:10.320 --> 25:15.560
And then I had some short term assignments, three months or so.

25:15.560 --> 25:27.280
And then they're on, Pakistan, Somalia, and Ecuador, and Yemen.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.800
And I kind of get upset.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.600
Nobody asked me to take a consultancy or anything.

25:32.600 --> 25:36.480
Eventually, you retired from the Texas Agricultural Extension Service at Texas.

25:36.480 --> 25:37.480
That's right.

25:37.480 --> 25:38.480
That's right.

25:38.480 --> 25:42.440
Because I had worked for them and I had worked for the experience station earlier.

25:42.440 --> 25:46.400
And I had enough time to retire.

25:46.400 --> 25:52.040
And then also USDA, USDA, economic research service.

25:52.040 --> 25:56.400
And I was posted in Ag Economics Department most of the time here.

25:56.400 --> 26:01.040
When you look back at your career and you sort of sum it up in your mind and your thoughts,

26:01.040 --> 26:05.760
obviously, you're proud of your service and proud of the people you served with.

26:05.760 --> 26:10.160
And I've always liked to keep in touch.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.160
Obviously.

26:12.160 --> 26:16.520
And people I know that I've had, it was friendships, I've values.

26:16.520 --> 26:22.520
We've had South Africans visit us here from the Orange Free State, University of Orange Free State.

26:22.520 --> 26:27.360
Two different couples have come and visited with us.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.160
And Cal Boykin, I want to thank you for your service.

26:29.160 --> 26:29.960
We are out of time.

26:29.960 --> 26:30.960
Like I said, we can get invited.

26:30.960 --> 26:31.760
Well, I appreciate it.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.160
I've been a lot of time, but you've had a remarkable life.

26:34.160 --> 26:34.680
Okay.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.680
And thank you.

26:35.680 --> 26:40.080
And Cal Boykin's service, both as a gunner, aboard his M8 Armored Car and his post-World

26:40.080 --> 26:45.200
War II civilian service is the kind of stuff of which our community can be forever proud.

26:45.200 --> 26:49.000
We salute him for his service as we salute all veterans.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
I'm Tom Terpaville.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.960
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:05.680 --> 27:16.280
I'll always remember this one.

27:16.280 --> 27:17.280
This will be good.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.280
This is a great book.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.280
All right.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.280
Okay.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.280
Let's look at that camera.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.280
Here we go.

27:24.280 --> 27:25.280
This is actually the same.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.280
Cal, this is the same one as last time.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.280
I'm going to do it for you again.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.280
So you'll have it on the same screen.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.280
Okay.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.280
Actually, I think it's a little bit different.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.440
Anyway, here we go.

27:34.440 --> 27:49.160
The 814th Tank Destroyer Battalion was attached to Patton's Army during the Allies' final push

27:49.160 --> 27:51.520
through Europe at the end of World War II.

27:51.520 --> 27:57.160
And college stations, Cal Boykin, was a gunner riding high on an M8 Armored Car, a historian

27:57.160 --> 27:58.840
and author, a soldier.

27:58.840 --> 28:03.280
We will wrap up our visit with Cal Boykin on Veterans of the Valley, Friday at 830,

28:03.280 --> 28:08.040
Saturday and Sunday at 630 right here on KAMU TV.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.040
Okay.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.040
Good.

28:10.040 --> 28:26.040
The 814th Tank Destroyer Battalion was attached to Patton's Army during the Allies' final push

28:26.040 --> 28:28.440
through Europe at the end of World War II.

28:28.440 --> 28:33.800
And college stations, Cal Boykin, was a gunner riding high on an M8 Armored Car, a historian

28:33.800 --> 28:35.320
and author, a soldier.

28:35.320 --> 28:40.120
We wrap up our visit with Cal Boykin on Veterans of the Valley, Friday at 830, Saturday

28:40.120 --> 28:52.000
and Sunday at 630 right here on KAMU TV.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.800
He's going to give us a final.

28:53.800 --> 28:54.600
Everything's okay.
