00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
That's why I brought this.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
Good afternoon.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
Welcome to the Johnson Space Center open house.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
We think we've exceeded our expectations.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
We thought we'd have about 20,000 people show up today just to the open house.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
We think that we're well over 70,000 now.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
We thank you.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
We certainly thank you for your support.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
I'm Sue Garman. I'm the executive assistant to the director of the Johnson Space Center on behalf of all the employees here.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
We're happy to have you here. We're happy to have all of our friends and neighbors in.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm glad that you support the United States Space Program.

00:57.000 --> 01:09.000
We hope that you have taken advantage and will for the rest of the time that the Space Center is open today of the unique opportunity to look around and see the kind of work that we do to help make sure that we have a human space flight program.

01:09.000 --> 01:18.000
This last session deals with the historic Apollo 13 mission and it features four of the flight controllers who successfully brought the astronauts home.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
We're going to follow this with a question and answer session.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
I may introduce them in order from my right on on across.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
First is Gene Cranff.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Gene holds a degree in aeronautical engineering.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Prior to coming to NASA, he worked as a flight loads test engineer at McDonald Aircraft.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
He served as a pilot in the Air Force and he worked as a flight test engineer at Holliman Air Force Base.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
He joined NASA in 1960 and worked as a flight director in both the Mercury and Gemini programs.

01:48.000 --> 01:58.000
As a flight director for the Apollo and the Skylab programs, he led the team in mission control during the first lunar landing and the successful return of the Apollo 13 crew.

01:58.000 --> 02:06.000
During the shuttle area era, Gene served as a deputy director of flight operations and the director of mission operations.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
He retired from NASA in 1994.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Jerry Griffin.

02:11.000 --> 02:23.000
Jerry Griffin holds a degree in aeronautical engineering.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.000
Prior to coming to NASA, he served as an officer in the Air Force and he worked as an aerospace engineer with the Douglas Aircraft company.

02:31.000 --> 02:40.000
He joined NASA in 1964 and he worked as a flight controller for all of the Gemini flights and as a flight director for all of the 11 Apollo missions.

02:40.000 --> 02:57.000
His positions at NASA included assistant administrator for legislative affairs, deputy associate administrator for man space flight, deputy director of the Dryden Flight Research Center, associate administrator for external relations, and deputy director of the Kennedy Space Center.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
He also served as a director of the Johnson Space Center from 1982 until his retirement from NASA.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
Next.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Next is Jerry Bostic. Jerry holds a degree in civil engineering.

03:15.000 --> 03:23.000
He joined NASA as an aerospace engineer at the Langley Space Center in 1962 and he transferred to Houston in the same year.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
He worked as a flight controller for the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab missions.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
He was the flight dynamics officer for the Apollo 13 mission.

03:32.000 --> 03:42.000
His other positions at NASA included executive assistant to the NASA administrator, deputy manager of the Space Shuttle program, and director of mission support.

03:42.000 --> 03:52.000
Since leaving NASA, he has worked as the vice president of space systems for grumman corporation and he is currently the director of business development for Northrop Grumman Technical Services.

03:52.000 --> 04:02.000
And on my far right is John Aaron. John holds a degree in physics.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
He joined NASA in 1964 as a vehicle systems engineer for the Gemini program.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
John was a flight controller for the Gemini and Apollo missions.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
During the Skylab program, he was a section head for electrical power, sequential and instrumentation systems.

04:19.000 --> 04:34.000
His other positions at NASA have included management positions working with spacecraft software, management positions with the space station program, acting assistant administrator for exploration, and assistant director of engineering at the Johnson Space Center.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
He is currently the manager of the Systems Engineering Office. Let's welcome all of them.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
Thank you.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
Okay, this is going to be a very informal session up here. We haven't rehearsed this script.

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
The Apollo 13, I think, was really had several key points associated with.

05:01.000 --> 05:10.000
The first thing was, I look at it as a real miracle of leadership. We were fortunate all of us up here to grow up under some exemplary leaders.

05:10.000 --> 05:19.000
We had George Miller. We had Jim McDevitt, George Lowe. We had Chris Kraft, Deeks Layton, Dr. Gilruth.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
Each of these people gave true meaning to authority with responsibility.

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
So that when it came time to fly missions, these folks were with us every step of the way. They gave us the job and they expected us to do it.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
I think that was one of the real keys to the success of that mission and all the missions that we had in the program.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
The second element was associated with the people. The people were universally young.

05:46.000 --> 05:56.000
They were convinced that the impossible was truly possible. They had gone through very rigorous training. They had grown up in the business of mission operations.

05:56.000 --> 06:10.000
And we would spend the days, weeks, months, and eventually the years together, not only working in mission control but working in our offices, building the game plan, developing confidence in ourselves and confidence in each other.

06:10.000 --> 06:18.000
The training personnel we had were the best in the world because those were the ones that gave us the can-do attitude, the never surrender.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
And with that kind of a background, we moved into the Apollo program.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
There had been several very key missions in Apollo and everyone up here worked those missions.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
We went to the moon in Apollo 11. We had difficulties getting down to the surface but we made it.

06:36.000 --> 06:47.000
Apollo 12, where you were struck by lightning and I believe Jerry was the flight director there and you've got another key guy in his right-hand air and you made the calls to get the spacecraft back to life again.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Apollo 13 came along so we were no...

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
The kinds of problems that we had, we were convinced we could work in the lake.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
So I think we were ready at 55-55 when the problem occurred on board the spacecraft.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
Everything had been normal up to that time. We had gone through two team rotations. We had four teams going.

07:07.000 --> 07:16.000
We had Milton Lur, the marine flight director who launched the mission I believe Jerry did, actually did the transposition in docking.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
I had the lunar orbit insertion. I was going to do the lunar acid.

07:21.000 --> 07:33.000
Glenn Loney was really the guy who was making sure that us rookies in the non-trijectory business did our work properly and by the book.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
So we had gone through the two team's successions and everything was optional up to that point. Jerry, why don't you say it?

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
I'd like to pick up on a couple of... in Amplify a couple of James Remarks.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
I think at the time...well I know at the time in my own case in Apollo 13 I was 35.

07:50.000 --> 07:58.000
I probably had more responsibility at age 34, 35, 36 and I've ever had before or since.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
And as Jean said, this was really important in Apollo 13 because when we did get into trouble,

08:06.000 --> 08:15.000
the senior management of the agency and the senior management of this center really only had one question of us on the flight control team.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
What can we do to help you? They really did leave the decision making to a bunch of young people.

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
I think Jean was probably 37 and he was probably the oldest flight director on that flight.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
I think John Aaron was 27 or something like that. Jerry was 28.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
No, you weren't.

08:38.000 --> 08:51.000
Anyway, it was a young person's game and then sometime when I reflect and we'll obviously in this session we'll get into more of the problem and how we fixed it and that sort of thing.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
One of the things I thought about after the flight was over and this didn't occur to me during the mission,

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
as soon as we landed every one of these lunar missions we didn't have much time to dwell on it. We had to go on to the next one.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
Well that was no exception in this case. The only difference is we had this big problem.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
And the amazing thing to me is that after we landed this was in April 1970.

09:15.000 --> 09:24.000
We had a complete accident investigation. We had a set of congressional hearings.

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
We had to go fix the problem, redo the command module pretty extensively in the oxygen system.

09:31.000 --> 09:38.000
And we went back to the moon in less than a year. In fact we were there in about 10 months later we flew Apollo 14.

09:38.000 --> 09:54.000
Now that shows you another difference in attitude that existed 25 years ago is when you had a problem and you had this adversity to overcome rather than wailing and gnashing of teeth and worrying about the future.

09:54.000 --> 10:01.000
You set the problem right and charged on because you had not changed your initial goals.

10:01.000 --> 10:11.000
And I think that was very fortunate time with today's oversight and other kinds of problems that you get into.

10:11.000 --> 10:18.000
It would be extremely difficult to do what we did in 1970-71 to get the program back on track.

10:18.000 --> 10:28.000
So I think it's a very interesting historical perspective and it's one we probably ought to keep in mind for the future.

10:28.000 --> 10:36.000
Finally, and I'm not going to say too much about it. I think Jerry Bostic ought to say something about the Apollo they've asked us to talk a little bit about the Apollo 13 movie.

10:36.000 --> 10:44.000
It was a great experience. Jerry and I got to work on it as technical advisors and is an interesting way that project got started.

10:44.000 --> 10:52.000
But maybe Jerry will fill you in on that. And I really do think it's brought alive a lot of interest in the American public.

10:52.000 --> 11:02.000
It's taken us back 25 years and it's brought up some of these successes and overcoming of failures that I think is a very positive thing and it's good for the space program.

11:02.000 --> 11:10.000
Jerry.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
I had forgotten how much older you guys were.

11:16.000 --> 11:27.000
The movie has brought a lot of attention back to the mission and it has caused all of us to reflect a lot on what happened 25 years ago.

11:27.000 --> 11:33.000
And it was kind of strange to me at first that almost everyone asked the same question.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Aren't you guys scared to death when the accident happened?

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
Aren't you running around ringing your hands and pulling your hair out?

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
And of course the answer was no. And in the next question is why.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
Well, the only reason I can think why is because of the training that we had had which was.

11:54.000 --> 12:04.000
I don't think we fully understood it at the time, but it's a good training for any endeavor that you undertake and that is to try to anticipate the problems that are going to happen.

12:04.000 --> 12:12.000
I have a plan of action for anything that you can dream of that will possibly come up.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
But in reality after the accident occurred.

12:18.000 --> 12:29.000
And for the next four days while we tried to figure out collectively how to get the crew home, we didn't have a lot of time to.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
To worry about anything except the task at hand and there was a time to ring your hands and pull their hair.

12:35.000 --> 12:49.000
It was a great example of teamwork over the past 10 years or so anyway in the in the aerospace industry.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
There's been a lot of attention on total quality management and.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Things like that and it.

12:58.000 --> 13:09.000
It occurred to me not too long ago that even though we didn't know it at the time, that's what we were all practicing here at Johnson Space Center 25 and 30 years ago.

13:09.000 --> 13:19.000
It was a true team work. Everybody knew the task that they had to do and we tried to do it the best that we could.

13:19.000 --> 13:27.000
Thank you.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
Maybe I could present a little bit of what my role was this mission and give you my impressions of what was accomplished.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
I was a systems engineer. I'm manned one of the the controller consoles and mission control center.

13:38.000 --> 13:48.000
My job was since there was two space ships involved going to the moon, one to be the mothership to transport the landing craft the moon called the lunar module.

13:48.000 --> 13:56.000
I was in charge of all the subsystems, all the vital systems and utilities to keep the both the mothership alive and sustained the crew.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
So I had a very important responsibility.

13:59.000 --> 14:06.000
My role in the mission was initially to be on the launch phase team as Jean mentioned and that would have rotate me and be in the landing phase.

14:06.000 --> 14:16.000
I wound up being on the part of the team that was charged with the awful decision of trying to decide whether or not to shut the mothership down as a result of this explosion.

14:16.000 --> 14:25.000
How much longer should we spend our precious power versus diagnosis in the system versus the decision to shut it down and depends truly on the lifeboat.

14:25.000 --> 14:36.000
Having been a part of that decision process, we then, while the lifeboat team tried to understand how to get the mothership back in the vicinity of the earth safely,

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
I was charged with the awful responsibility of leading the team that says given that these guys, the lifeboat team can get us back in the vicinity of the earth,

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
is there any way to turn this thing back on given this limited power that we've got.

14:49.000 --> 14:57.000
The reason I bring you through that sequence is not only a quaint you with my responsibility was, but I think the thing that I most well fit that mission is,

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
as I sum it up to people, my conclusion is it works.

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
Now, what I mean by that is, in any complex endeavor like going to the moon, of which stuff is a very complex endeavor,

15:10.000 --> 15:18.000
and we on the ground here as part of the design team, we did design, design, design, and we did train, train, train, and what if planning,

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
we tried to cover every contingency we trained day and night.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
I think what this mission serves as, it's a model of that.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
There is a method by which, you know, I only can train and design for all the cases you think will happen to you,

15:32.000 --> 15:42.000
but that very method and model and training process will help you react in a very successful way to things you never envisioned and never thought you could handle.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
We wound up with a situation that we never trained for.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
The spacecraft, the mission was certainly never designed for, but those fundamental methods in this management team and this process,

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
are served to be the thing that got us home.

15:56.000 --> 16:06.000
I think that's a model for our future that says complex endeavors, there is a method to handle the things you don't really train for, but the things you don't.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
As usual, John is being extremely modest about his role in the mission.

16:12.000 --> 16:24.000
He had it a team, actually, that had to try to figure out, indeed, how, that we could get the spacecraft back with the consumables that we had on board.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.000
We didn't have enough water, we didn't have enough electricity, we didn't have enough oxygen.

16:30.000 --> 16:48.000
And being a guy who worried about how to get to the people home from an Inflight trajectory standpoint, if I wanted to burn the engine or turn the platform on or anything to use the guidance system,

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
I was going to go to John to try to convince him that I needed five hours of...

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
One hour, one hour, one hour, ten minutes.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
Actually, at the time, we were at 55 hours into the mission.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
We were at our second rotation of the flight control team.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
It takes a while to get into the groove.

17:12.000 --> 17:22.000
We always looked towards that trans lunar phase as sort of a way to come up to speed in all of our homework, doing the final tag-ups with the various flight controllers we got.

17:22.000 --> 17:29.000
And just get ourselves ready for the events that would occur once we went into lunar orbit.

17:29.000 --> 17:41.000
We had finished the TV show, secured the downlink, and one of the things the flight controllers always pride themselves in is getting the crew to sleep on time and not having to wake them up during the sleep period.

17:42.000 --> 17:49.000
We were in the process of doing this when we asked the crew to go through a cryo-ster.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
And we did this because the cryogen extended to stratify in the tank.

17:53.000 --> 18:04.000
And we always liked to get our best measurement gauging on the cryo-tankage during the crew sleep period because we knew pretty much what their metabolic use was.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
So we could get a good handle on our consumables.

18:08.000 --> 18:15.000
So we told the crew to stir the cries, and Jack Swagger reached over, and he flipped four switches.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
Down in the ground, within just the next three seconds, three controllers reported the problem.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
And there was the guidance officer who identified that we had a hardware restart.

18:29.000 --> 18:37.000
Enco came in and said, Enco is the communications officer that we had switched from narrow to wide beam.

18:37.000 --> 18:45.000
And simultaneously, with that, we got a call from the ECOMS position that we had a main B undervolt.

18:45.000 --> 18:53.000
And about that time, hey, excuse me, Jack Swagger first, and then the level second came down and said, Houston, we got a problem.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
And it was funny how your mind works because the first thing I thought, which ones are you talking about?

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
Are you talking about the hardware restart? The main B undervolt or the communications problem?

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
And that wiped clear in just a second.

19:06.000 --> 19:14.000
And then you started listening up to the loops and all the controllers started to come on loops because virtually everybody in the control center had some,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
we're seeing some symptoms of the problems that occurred.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
And it was really confusing for those first two to three to four minutes because the reports kept coming in.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Nothing made sense.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
The crew was changing the configuration on board to spacecraft.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
So about the time we'd get ready to make some recommendation to them.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
That recommendation would change because it changed something else.

19:35.000 --> 19:46.000
The GNNC or the guidance and control guy was worried because he was seeing a lot of pressure decay on the

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
quads, the RCS jets that we used for attitude control.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
And this is because we didn't know it was at that time an explosion.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
But a shock had gone through the spacecraft that closed a lot of the valves.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
Actually, we were just bringing the propellant and the manifold to the jets and the manifold pressures were decaying.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
The spacecraft was in capable of being controlled. It was very difficult three or four minutes.

20:08.000 --> 20:15.000
But then after about three to three and a half minutes, the basic discipline and the training of the team and the quality of the spacecraft

20:15.000 --> 20:26.000
that the controllers started to take over in particular, the control guy recognized that the jets had been the valves had been closed.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And that's why we couldn't control attitudes.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
So we now started solving our attitude problem.

20:31.000 --> 20:39.000
The communications guy came up and said, hey, until we get our attitude problem nailed down, let's use the omnithenic.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
So now we were getting information constantly into the spacecraft.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
The guidance officer, by this time very quickly, had come up and said he had the time of the hardware restart.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
So now we could start tracing back in our data at the possible time this occurred.

20:54.000 --> 21:02.000
So the control team over the next 10 to 15 minutes continued to work their problems with one exception.

21:02.000 --> 21:11.000
And that was the ECOM, Cyliburga, who had the consistent problems associated with the fuel cells and the cryogenics.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
And it became obvious. We were tracing, we were chasing instrumentation problems early.

21:16.000 --> 21:23.000
But by the time we were about 10 to 15 minutes into this episode, it became obvious that we were seeing some real problems.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
But we are still dubious about what information we could truly believe.

21:28.000 --> 21:38.000
But the crew, the controllers, the entire team was coming to the conclusion that we had problems in fuel cells, problems in cries, and it looked like at least two fuel cells were done.

21:38.000 --> 21:44.000
And about this time, about 15 minutes into this entire episode.

21:44.000 --> 21:56.000
We were in the process of changing shift, Lennon, it come in, and turned the gland and told him to get a hold of Chris that he better get in because we're in deep, serious trouble.

21:56.000 --> 22:06.000
And it was just frustrating to see the lifeblood in these fuel cells and cryo-escaping and not being able to do anything about it.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
And then Jim Lovell came down and said we're vetting something.

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
And as soon as he said venting, that then sinked, I think, everybody in the team.

22:15.000 --> 22:21.000
I think everybody is sort of sent a chill down your spine that says, my God, we had some type of an explosion.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
And in my mind, the first thought I had was survival.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
That we're now in a survival situation.

22:27.000 --> 22:34.000
And these guys up here, it's somewhere along the line in their careers flight controllers, have looked at this thing we call the Doomsday scenario.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
And you look at straight in the face, and it's sort of gets your attention.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Let me go ahead.

22:40.000 --> 22:49.000
Interestingly enough, because Jean and I talked about this, when the accident first happened, our thought was, now what do we got to do to go ahead with this landing mission?

22:50.000 --> 22:57.000
And then, and you got to know you got to that survival mode in a couple of steps, because that was the way we were trained.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
When it happens, what do we have to do now to make sure we can still land okay?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
And Jim Lovell was thinking the same way.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
He said, you know, we've had some kind of problem, but we'll get this fixed and go on and land on the moon.

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
So it was interesting how you kind of step down, and all of a sudden you say there's no more options left.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
Now the game is to get them back, and forget the mission of going to the moon.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
We never trained to this Doomsday scenario, because it's non-beneficial.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
I mean, you end up killing the crew and the controllers, and up going home.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
So you never trained to this.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
So all of the training that we have, there's always some way out.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
And that's a way we're trained.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
And it went through my mind, in fact, in the voice loops.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Let's not do anything that's going to blow the mission.

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
Well, I was still thinking, well, if we can't land in the moon, we're going to go into orbit around the moon kind of thing.

23:46.000 --> 23:53.000
So it's the training process, it's interesting how your mind downloads under this kind of situation.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
We continued to work on this thing for the best part of another hour.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
We recognized very quickly, and we had two things going for us.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
In Apollo 9 mission, we had built something we call the lifeboat procedures.

24:07.000 --> 24:15.000
And about 45 minutes into this crisis, we went and proceeded to start digging out these lifeboat procedures.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Because once you do something like that, you always save it.

24:17.000 --> 24:27.000
The other thing that was useful on this mission was we had done a lot of maneuvers using the LEM spacecraft during Apollo 9.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
And all that data was in archives.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
So we really started going two directions.

24:31.000 --> 24:38.000
We had to get the data out of archives from the Apollo 9 mission and the rest of controllers to dig out their lifeboat procedures.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
So I think that's all that these guys continue for a while.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Yeah.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Interesting.

24:43.000 --> 24:52.000
And I just don't know what made me think of this, but it'll show you a little bit how, by the time we got to Apollo 13, how we were thinking about going to the moon.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
This was our third landing mission.

24:54.000 --> 25:00.000
We had been there twice before on 10 and 8 and did not Apollo 10 and Apollo 8 and did not land.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
So we, this was not a brand new experience.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
And I recall I had, in fact, Jane relieved me.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
I was the off-going flight director with my team.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
And I was off playing a softball.

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
I went down to South Houston here somewhere and was playing a softball game with some of the other flight controllers.

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
And we finished the game and I went back to one of the fellow's apartments to get a cool one.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
And we got a call that there had been a problem.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
And we'd better get back out to the, to the center.

25:30.000 --> 25:38.000
And I remember walking back, the first time I walked back into the control center, I had all my sweatsuit still from, from baseball or playing softball.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
It then became very apparent I better get, I lived in Nassau Bay at that point right across the street here.

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
I got home very fast to get some sleep because I knew I was going to have to rotate back in the next morning.

25:50.000 --> 25:58.000
Let me draw a slight parallel here with the, with the movie that I'm sure many of you have seen.

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
Actually my take and I got there probably 30 to 45 minutes after the accident happened.

26:04.000 --> 26:11.000
When I walked in, things were as calm, it looked just like a routine simulation that maybe a training simulation or something.

26:11.000 --> 26:17.000
There were a few more people in the room because people had come back to, to see what was going on and what was happening.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
But I'll never be, I never will forget that first look at the thing.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
It was, it was a very calm room.

26:24.000 --> 26:31.000
People were going about their business, Gene and, and Glen Loney were at the flight director console talking things over.

26:31.000 --> 26:36.000
And if there was a stillness and a calmness, it was kind of eerie.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
The movie probably overplayed a little bit and they had to do that.

26:40.000 --> 26:46.000
In fact, Ron Howard told, Jerry and me both that there's going to be times in this movie where I have to make a video.

26:47.000 --> 26:53.000
I'm going to make it a little more emotional to make it entertaining because it's not a documentary.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
It's, it was, it had to be an entertaining movie.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
So there, he took a little poetic license or dramatic license in a couple of places.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
But let me say this about the movie.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
The technical parts of it were correct.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
There's a few errors in some of them.

27:06.000 --> 27:12.000
I know some of the, the NASA people could find little errors in the thing that they weren't quite right.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
But the technical track and what we did and how we did it was very accurate.

27:18.000 --> 27:30.000
The other thing that that I remember about the, about this first period is the fact that the whole not only the people here at the Johnson Space Center,

27:30.000 --> 27:36.000
but the whole world-wide team responded just like that.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
We had recovery forces all over the world.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
We had carriers and we had destroyers.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
We had helicopters and we had other countries that would help us.

27:46.000 --> 27:52.000
And it was very interesting to see how that all really snapped into action right away.

27:52.000 --> 28:01.000
My team, when I got back on, was heavily involved in trying to plan the right, as Jerry said, the right trajectory to get us back.

28:02.000 --> 28:08.000
And the response, we were moving, steaming carriers and destroyers and moving airplanes all over the world.

28:08.000 --> 28:14.000
And it was just an amazing, amazing logistics kind of effort.

28:14.000 --> 28:25.000
And it all worked and we ended up doing a maneuver after we went around the moon to bring us back to a more favorable position in the Pacific where we had some recovery forces.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
We'd left him alone after we got him back on a free return.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
They were going to land out in the Indian Ocean with nobody out there.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
So we could have probably gotten him back, but it would have been a different time.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Jerry, why don't you cover the trajectory options?

28:39.000 --> 28:47.000
Where we were when the accident happened, what the options were at that time, why we waved off a couple options and what we did from then on.

28:48.000 --> 29:00.000
Okay. Jerry just reminded when he was talking about that, one of the things that the people have forgotten or never knew, I guess, is that at the time the accident happened, we were on what we called a non free return trajectory.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
But it's met that it would go around the moon.

29:04.000 --> 29:10.000
If we didn't have to that, I said it would go around the moon, come back toward the earth, but missed by several thousand miles.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
In orbit forever.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
In orbit forever.

29:13.000 --> 29:26.000
On the previous flight, 11 and 12 to the moon, we had been on a free return trajectory, which meant if we did nothing to go around the moon and come back and get the earth.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Hopefully at the right angle.

29:29.000 --> 29:51.000
Anyway, as I said, on 13 for the first time, we had departed from that not too long after translinear injection, we had done a small maneuver to get the phasing and the lighting right for the place that we will in the land on 13 and that put us on this non free return.

29:52.000 --> 30:05.000
So, after, within a few minutes after the accident, it was obvious that we had a serious problem and that we weren't going to be landing on the moon or even going in orbit around it.

30:05.000 --> 30:11.000
The main thing we wanted to do from a trajectory standpoint was to get them back to our free return.

30:12.000 --> 30:23.000
We still didn't know what the problem was, we didn't know how severe it was, but everybody agreed that it would be a pretty thing to do to get them on a path that would bring them back to earth.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.000
We left them there for about a day until we went around the moon.

30:29.000 --> 30:50.000
And then, as Jerry mentioned, that free return maneuver that we did, we bring them back to earth, but they had them landing in the end in ocean, which is not a crime spot because we didn't have the recovery forces out there that you would like for and the crimes like that.

30:51.000 --> 31:15.000
So, the next day, we did another large maneuver that sped them up a little bit, got them home a little quicker and moved their landing point over to the Pacific Ocean, which is a place where we would like to have it, even though we were worried about a hurricane coming up in a top and I guess they call them out there.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
So, we had a storm, and we kept bouncing around through that area that added a bit of spice to our life.

31:20.000 --> 31:41.000
But while the trajectory guys were trying to figure out how to get them back, what engines we could burn because the type of maneuvers that we were, the type of maneuvers that we needed to do, you would normally use the main engine on the service module.

31:41.000 --> 31:51.000
And we rightfully so concluded that it was available anymore. We didn't know that really until later on, but we didn't want to take the rest.

31:51.000 --> 32:10.000
But while we were trying to figure out what engines to burn and how much and how quick to get them back and what ocean to put them in, John and his guys were trying to figure out how to squeeze everything they could out of the consumables because it would be academic if we got them back to the right.

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
I don't know if it was right ocean at the right time, but they ran out of oxygen four days or.

32:16.000 --> 32:29.000
My concern was while you were off computing all these very large and very delicate maneuvers that you had to do, my concern was that what jury represented me, it took a lot of power and a lot of consumables to represent what he did.

32:29.000 --> 32:36.000
I'd like to pick up at that point and comment that they mentioned earlier about being scared.

32:36.000 --> 32:45.000
The rest of the team may not have been scared, but with respect to what the oxygen tanks meant to the mission, let me put that in context for you.

32:45.000 --> 33:01.000
When I heard that the oxygen tanks were the thing they had a problem when you go through the worst case scenario, those oxygen tanks were the lifeline of the mission because oxygen is not only obviously what the crew breathes, but these spacecrafts were very white, efficient designed.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
Oxygen was the thing that you not only breathed, you took oxygen and made electricity out of it.

33:05.000 --> 33:17.000
It was a bioprotomechan electricity that produced water. Water was the thing that the crew had to drink, reconstitute the food, and then we used the final aspects of the water to cool the equipment.

33:17.000 --> 33:28.000
So literally the oxygen tanks were the thing that was at the top of the supply line for all the critical things that sustained the spacecraft.

33:28.000 --> 33:38.000
When we began to look at giving that primary power system was gone, a whole new set of thinking, a whole new team spring into action.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
Right after we got the command module turned down and actually turned it off.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
We all assembled in a room and tried to decide what could we do.

33:47.000 --> 33:54.000
This is when the resources of the whole country came alive with respect to the team we put together.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
It's easy to visualize that you get a lot of help coming in from all the country.

33:57.000 --> 34:06.000
The most difficult thing to do sometimes is to ask the right questions, set up the right scenarios so that you can get productive use of that help that comes in around the country.

34:06.000 --> 34:19.000
I think one of the things, the leadership of that offline team that we set up in that offline room that was really the thing that put together that totally non-traditional sequence of how we could turn the command module back on.

34:19.000 --> 34:27.000
Lever is not only the people that were trained in that room but we leveraged the whole country and the whole world with respect to how does this hard very really work?

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
Can we drain just a little bit more out of it?

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
To pose you use it this way. I know you didn't design it that way. It's not supposed to work that way but could we do it?

34:36.000 --> 34:44.000
That invoked a team that we had offline going that literally pulsed every manufacturer in this whole country.

34:44.000 --> 34:51.000
Yeah, the John was talking about the 210 operations or about six things that had to be done down there.

34:51.000 --> 35:01.000
The first one was to, and Jerry mentioned it, how to figure out how to use this lunar propulsion systems to do all of the maneuvers we needed to get back home.

35:01.000 --> 35:07.000
We're fortunate because we had a starting point with the maneuvers that we had used in Apollo 9.

35:07.000 --> 35:15.000
John talked about the power profile, the initial indications we had. We're about day short in power profile.

35:15.000 --> 35:27.000
Right when we started and then Glenn and I came up with the scheme to keep powered up until we went around the backside of the moon, which made us almost two days short the John had to figure out.

35:27.000 --> 35:34.000
Before we could start getting better, we made things a heck of a lot worse there.

35:34.000 --> 35:45.000
There were a couple other key folks. One of the things we had to do is to, and before we could power down, was to figure out how to realign our navigation system.

35:45.000 --> 36:00.000
Because we were, the spacecraft was cruising along in a floating cloud of frozen oxygen molecules and debris from the explosion and crew couldn't use any of their optics and see out through this cloud.

36:00.000 --> 36:09.000
Phil Schaffer was one of the guys who was tagged from the trench to come up with the techniques for platform realignment.

36:09.000 --> 36:18.000
And we had to have that procedure nailed down and confidence in before we could power down and let give John the time at which we powered in.

36:18.000 --> 36:26.000
So then in addition to that, then we had to figure out how we're going to power that because in the power up, there were a lot of the systems in the command module.

36:26.000 --> 36:38.000
They were concerned might be frozen up water batteries, those kinds of things. And then they had to reenter. Now the one thing that in all of my planning and bookkeeping work we did, I had completely overlooked was this live thing.

36:38.000 --> 36:47.000
And this is where a great outfit called the spacecraft analysis team came in. And this is where again, the core engineering of Johnson came in.

36:47.000 --> 37:00.000
They recognized that the flight control team had their hands full with what they were trying to do. They also recognized that eventually we'd fill up that entire spacecraft with CO2.

37:00.000 --> 37:09.000
And again, as we say, this was a problem that had to be solved. They want about solving the thing and procedure. I think they brought the solution into you. Didn't they, Jerry?

37:09.000 --> 37:20.000
Which is real neat. So why don't you talk about that? Well, that was a thing done by our engineering folks here is that got turned on as Jean was talking about lithium hydroxide is what liao means.

37:20.000 --> 37:33.000
It's a canister like something like your air conditioner filter. It filters the air that the crew is breathing and it takes out the carbon dioxide and captures it in this lithium hydroxide trap.

37:33.000 --> 37:44.000
Well, we didn't have enough of those of the right shape and size. And in the movie, if you'll remember, they made this device out of a through a bunch of stuff on the table. Didn't quite happen that way, but that's closer.

37:44.000 --> 37:54.000
Through a bunch of stuff on the table and said, look, this is what these guys have on board. Let's figure out how to run this, put a square peg in around hole essentially.

37:54.000 --> 38:10.000
So using duct tape and flight plan covers, they were able to use a command module canister in the lunar module hole. Now what that did then is in the, we used a measurement called the partial pressure CO2.

38:10.000 --> 38:23.000
If that gets up, if it gets up to what about 15 parts per million and it gone, that's where it gets dangerous. People start thinking fuzzy and it can kill them and they pass out and then die of CO2 poisoning.

38:23.000 --> 38:42.000
It was up about 12 or 13 when they finally put this fix up against the hole in the command module taped it all in, blocked up all the vents and immediately the pressure partial pressure CO2 started to drop and it went down below one.

38:42.000 --> 39:01.000
Actually, it worked as good as the lunar module canister. So that was a, you talked about, and I know many of you guys in GALS are involved in your own shops and that kind of thing. That's the kind of plan it was. It was a little bit like a scavenger hunt. See what you can find and make this thing work. Any work extremely well.

39:01.000 --> 39:18.000
One of the things that kept bothering us all the way through the reentry phase, or the returned earth phase was this trajectory shallowing because by this time we had had a pretty good handle. We didn't have all the solutions but we had a pretty good handle on the problems we had.

39:18.000 --> 39:28.000
We saw ourselves converging solution wise, the crew saw the earth coming up but the one nagging thing that was always there was this trajectory shallowing.

39:28.000 --> 39:35.000
Jerry, why don't you talk about what you do and do that? You really test in his memory.

39:35.000 --> 39:45.000
Well, for all of us, it seemed like we had one problem after another. At the time we would get one solved or we thought it had a solved.

39:45.000 --> 39:57.000
We would be faced with another one. But obviously to come back to re-earned into the earth and survive, you have to hit it at the right angle. And as Jean said, we kept getting more shallow, more shallow, more shallow.

39:57.000 --> 40:09.000
We would hit the atmosphere and skip out like a rock on a pond. And we really couldn't figure out what was causing it. We kept asking all the systems guys, what are you vending?

40:09.000 --> 40:26.000
As a result of that, we had to do a last minute mid course corridor control burn. I guess we call it to make sure that we hit the right angle when we entered the earth.

40:26.000 --> 40:42.000
We entered the earth's atmosphere. But it turned out that we were vending something. It was one of those things that was designed as a non-propulsive bent.

40:42.000 --> 41:04.000
But we learned that it's real hard to design and manufacture a non-propulsive bent in space. So it was almost a continuous small perturbation to the trajectory that was enough to over several hours to change the course.

41:04.000 --> 41:20.000
It was, these kind of nagging prongs really bother you because you don't have any answer form. And when they came up with their final maneuver, we had just finished reading up two hours of checklists up to swigart and he had those copied.

41:20.000 --> 41:34.000
And then one hour of checklists to haze and then the trench comes in and says by the way we need another maneuver. And I mean this was sort of frustrating because everybody sort of tired. But anyway, everything turned out the way it should have been.

41:34.000 --> 41:58.000
Then we got up finally to the big time. John had got us enough power now that we were very comfortable with the power margins we had. And in fact, we had sufficient power in the limb spacecraft to start charging the command and service module batteries, which now we had moved positive power margins. So John, why don't you take us from there through entry and then we'll go for questions.

41:58.000 --> 42:08.000
Now, Jean mentioned that the key thing was power because the to give you a feel for how much we were talking about normally the mothership was never powered down the space. We powered up.

42:08.000 --> 42:27.000
So when we powered up was always on the ground. Now, you took six or eight hours of very intense sequences to do. We couldn't have enough power to do that. We had enough for about an hour and a half at a very reduced level because the oxygen was all gone of the normal power was all gone. We were down to the about the equivalent of three car batteries that had been already discharged as I'm degreeing.

42:27.000 --> 42:37.000
The secret was the key was how we could do that. We only had a certain amount of power. And as Jerry said, we put together a process whereby they essentially made my team the power brokers.

42:37.000 --> 42:52.000
Ever, everything that anybody wanted to do with that spacecraft, they had to come with us and convince us that we had to turn it on. And our usual answer was no. You don't get it. You got to do this a different, you got to do this a different way. Think about doing it this way.

42:52.000 --> 43:15.000
In the end, what we did was invent a sequence that and not too long in terms I referred to as we just powered up the spaceship backwards. Normally the way you power up the spaceship as you turn on all the support systems so that you do a very orderly process all the basic support systems and then start turning on the sophisticated systems like the guidance systems and so forth.

43:15.000 --> 43:28.000
We decided to power the spaceship up in the blind. We went to turn the long lead guidance systems on first, assuming that the crew would do it perfectly and everything would go exactly as planned with no margin. And then we would turn on the support systems last.

43:28.000 --> 43:41.000
So that so that meant we had no insight into that, but that did give us one chance to do this and it depended on the crew doing it perfectly. And after four days of almost no water, no sleep, they did do it perfectly.

43:41.000 --> 43:46.000
That was turned out to be the key to the sequence of how we could do it.

43:46.000 --> 44:00.000
So anyway, they probably the greatest sight as we were going through this final power up. I think every flight controller for every team was sitting somewhere within the control room.

44:00.000 --> 44:09.000
The viewing room was full to overflowing all of our instructors and thank God for our instructors. They were often the training room off to the right.

44:09.000 --> 44:19.000
And it really still I still get misty to these days because going through this blackout and I don't think anybody has ever explained why the blackout we were almost two minutes longer.

44:19.000 --> 44:31.000
Normally, we were normally four minutes. This here was almost six minutes. And I'll tell you what, your heart, as you'd call up, you exit blackout and boy, give a call and then silence.

44:31.000 --> 44:46.000
And then you give another call and then silence. And you watch that clock in the wall count up and up and then try it again and every concern you ever had relative to the mission really starts to grab a hold in your second air.

44:46.000 --> 44:56.000
And then all of a sudden, it's real neat. You got a call, a riot, a OS. And then from the carrier, you had the reports of the sonic booms.

44:56.000 --> 45:07.000
Okay, then you had radar contact and then three beautiful parachutes. Oh boy, were they beautiful. And from then on, boy, it was celebrating.

45:07.000 --> 45:25.000
I mean, it was get the cigars out and we'll always wait until the crews and the deck of the carrier. But boy, if there's ever a luscious smell that these kids today aren't going to get it's that it's that whole room full of cigar smoke with people cheering.

45:25.000 --> 45:42.000
Pat and each other in the back flagging the American flags, etc. And boy, I hope someday that when our kids today take the next generation to Mars, somebody's going to reopen that room for cigar smoke and again.

45:42.000 --> 46:03.000
I guess it's time to ask questions. If any of you have questions, just I think there's microphones. Come on up.

46:03.000 --> 46:30.000
Yeah, there's Michael over in the other side also the same. Well, somebody's getting to the microphone. Let me just add one thing right quick. I alluded to it and I thought the proud father sitting on my right might say something about it. But the reason Apollo 13, the movie, came to be a real project was because of jury, Bostick's son, Mike, Mike's a young 32 year old, been in California for a few years, worked for Ron Howard for a number of years.

46:30.000 --> 46:47.000
He went to Clear Lake High School, his job was finding properties to make movies out of. And he heard about this book that Jeff Cleager and Jeff Cleager were going to write. It hadn't even been finished.

46:47.000 --> 46:57.000
But Mike took the concept to Ron and Ron bought it and we now have this very successful movie. But it all started with Jerry's son.

46:57.000 --> 47:17.000
I just have two questions. First one is what happened to the service module and the landing module and they were jettison. I was never clear where they went. Did they reenter or burned up somewhere?

47:17.000 --> 47:35.000
They burned up Earth's atmosphere. Okay. The movie sort of, I thought, shed a not too good light on the contractor support there. And as a new employee of one of the contractors.

47:35.000 --> 47:50.000
I just curious what if that's that if that was true at the time and what it's like now. No, it was not true. And if there was one thing I didn't like about the movie because it happened to work for that company.

47:50.000 --> 48:02.000
And I might add in a very nice way. But I would add that within the contractors and state design and built and tested it to specifications with NASA offered up. There was constant given.

48:02.000 --> 48:26.000
But between can we do this beyond what despite the hard words designed to do and there always was this given tape. We were there was a very constructive given tag between the contractor community and the NASA engineers. But it was always very constructive. There was never an adversarial relationship. That was an amazing team. And it was hard sometimes to find the scene between the NASA engineers and the contractor engineers. We were one homogenous team.

48:26.000 --> 48:41.000
Let me add to the movie because this is it's a good point that you caught it when we got to that piece of it. Jerry and and I both said, Ron, you need to be careful with that because that's not exactly the way it happened.

48:41.000 --> 49:10.000
Well, before we started shooting the movie, Ron told us he said, anytime you see anything wrong, any of you guys let us know. And he said, in about I guess 95% of the time 96 maybe he accepted everything and would turn it around. But he told us he said, there are going to be times when I'm going to say, thank you for your input. And now I've got to make a movie. And that was the one case where he did.

49:10.000 --> 49:28.000
I just wanted to ask a question. You mentioned all the redundancy and the training. When I also read the book, nobody ever obviously conceived that the lunar module had to support them. But the CO2 canisters, why didn't somebody think to make them interchangeable from the very beginning?

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
That's good question.

49:32.000 --> 49:44.000
What I would suggest you do, you know, they're building a space station here. I would suggest you maybe look at compatibility between maybe some of the US and the Russian systems so that that kind of a problem doesn't occur.

49:44.000 --> 50:02.000
Well, I think if you think about it, the object was to get the moon. The way to get the moon was for a large team and organized about what I divide and conquer. And you give major organizations a major job and you let them do it. And the business about, well, one solution may be a square peg and the other solution may be around home.

50:02.000 --> 50:22.000
We had cases of life like that. But that was what was involved in that you would do that. But to go back and make all your specifications across the board, compatibility takes time. It takes money. And we were about going to the moon in 69, not about designing bio-canon shirts that were interchangeable.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
And it was a move to the design.

50:25.000 --> 50:37.000
Yeah, and one other point too. The lunar module, many of you know, is probably blessed, hard boy, it always performed well. But it was probably it was one of the ugliest children we ever, you know, had.

50:37.000 --> 50:50.000
And it was designed for functionality. And I suspect that the reason that that canister was was was round. And it was a geometry issue because that cockpit was just cram full of stuff.

50:50.000 --> 50:56.000
And it was tight. But it didn't have it had a little more flexibility. You could get that bigger square canister in there.

50:56.000 --> 51:02.000
It also had a different shape. The volume was a bit. The volume was different. That's it.

51:02.000 --> 51:15.000
I have two questions. One is, why did the projector keep on getting shower? And the other one is, what if this explosion had taken place on the way back from the moon? Could you have gotten back?

51:15.000 --> 51:22.000
I'm sorry, I didn't hear the second one. What if the explosion had taken place on the way back from the moon instead of on the way to the moon? Could you have gotten back?

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Okay.

51:23.000 --> 51:34.000
Well, we found that later, the reason the trajectory was was showering is that we were boiling off helium in the lunar module.

51:34.000 --> 51:39.000
And as I mentioned, it was supposed to be going through a non-propulsive band.

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
But there is no such thing. Little bit of thrust. Little bit of thrust.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
There it was. It was moving.

51:46.000 --> 51:58.000
If the explosion had happened on the way back from the moon and we didn't have the lunar module, we wouldn't have made it.

51:58.000 --> 52:09.000
And if it had been, you know, the same type of malfunction, we wouldn't have made it.

52:09.000 --> 52:16.000
In fact, believe it or not, it happened about the only time in the mission we could have done anything about it.

52:16.000 --> 52:25.000
It was late enough that we could squeeze the consumables out of the limb to get back. And it was earlier enough that we still had the limb and all of this capability.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Four quarters.

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
Two questions over here.

52:32.000 --> 52:43.000
One quick one is that as maybe this was dramatic license on Ron Howard's part, but that control burn to improve the angle seemed to be like about a stable as a bottle rocket.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
Was it really that unstable?

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
I guess the second. Yes, sir.

52:50.000 --> 52:56.000
What they did there is, and it was much of a, what happened in the movie?

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
When they first filmed, I guess if he had put most of everything he wanted to in there, he would have been a four hour movie.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
He was saying maybe we're going to have another war and peace here. So he had to chop it down.

53:05.000 --> 53:12.000
And what he was trying to depict, it was a very level on the first burn that they did in a dock fashion.

53:12.000 --> 53:19.000
He and Fred Hayes had to learn a whole new way of controlling the vehicle because the center gravity had of this pair had changed.

53:19.000 --> 53:24.000
And when you fired trying to translate, it would rotate the whole stack.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
And when you tried to translate or rotate it would translate.

53:27.000 --> 53:33.000
So they had to figure out new controls, a little bit like Revenger, head and panacea stomach or vice versa.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
Yes, so what you saw in the movie was digging the first burn.

53:36.000 --> 53:44.000
It was more of a composite of all three major burns that we did, but more like the first one.

53:44.000 --> 53:52.000
And so they got that learning curve, the crew got that learning curve down later, where they were actually pretty comfortable in doing this.

53:52.000 --> 54:01.000
And I think Fred Hayes control role and swagger time the engine burn and level handle pitch.

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
And so they finally got this thing down to where they could control it.

54:06.000 --> 54:12.000
But what Ron was trying to show is that there was this problem, it was different. And so we kind of got compressed.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
But I like your bottle rocket term. That's pretty accurate description.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
The first burn they did had a lot of.

54:19.000 --> 54:28.000
A lot of that. I guess the second question is that after all this, after the guidance is all hosed up, how close to the ship did they actually land?

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Close.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
You know, I don't remember, but you could see it from the ship.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Yeah, it was close.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
It was one of the closest ones that we had.

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
Yeah, I remember we moved the carrier a mile off the entry because we almost hit one.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
Yeah, what's the carrier?

54:40.000 --> 54:45.000
One of the things, actually, they final burn, they overburdened.

54:45.000 --> 54:52.000
They actually targeted the overburden there, which brought us in a bit short, which brought us closer to the carrier than we had been previously.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
It was close. It was within eyesight of the carrier.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
It was two miles, two to five miles.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
Thank you.

54:58.000 --> 55:04.000
We overburdened to make sure that we knew that it wasn't going to show out anymore anymore.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
But it won the steepest of the movie.

55:07.000 --> 55:16.000
Well, first I'd like to congratulate you on your performance in the mission, and I would like to say that you are true American heroes.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Thank you.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
Thank you.

55:18.000 --> 55:39.000
Well, my question is, well, before the crew jettisoned the service module, you had no idea of the extent of the explosion.

55:39.000 --> 55:46.000
And of course, after it was jettisoned, the crew took a picture of it as it was floating away towards the atmosphere.

55:46.000 --> 55:53.000
What was going through your mind whenever you saw those pictures for the first time seeing how massive the explosion was?

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
I think this is a good question for everybody.

55:56.000 --> 56:05.000
For my mind, because we had had a very intense debate in the control center, it was relatively short, whether to use the service propulsion engine.

56:05.000 --> 56:11.000
And Sarlovis lined up, I lined up and said, hey, we don't want to use it because we don't know what happened back there.

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
The first thing that went through my mind was, thank God, we didn't use it.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
We tried to do that.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
Yeah, that's first thing.

56:17.000 --> 56:24.000
And of course, remember, we didn't see that picture immediately because we had to get the camera, but we didn't have TV on it.

56:24.000 --> 56:29.000
The crew took the picture, but they described it.

56:29.000 --> 56:34.000
And Jim said the whole panel on the side of that thing is blown out.

56:34.000 --> 56:42.000
The word picture, I had the same reaction that Jean did is, I had two thoughts.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
One was, thank God we didn't use the service engine, service propulsion system.

56:45.000 --> 56:54.000
But the second thing was, I wonder what's going to happen to that heat shield because the heat shield was the next question, just from his word description.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
It was frightening.

56:55.000 --> 57:01.000
My main thought was, I'm glad we didn't see it earlier because we didn't have that in the world.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
I'm really worried a lot more.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
How long did the actual explosion last?

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
16 seconds.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
From the time they flipped the switches until the panel was gone.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
This is kind of a two part question.

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
I'd like to find out what each of you, briefly, what each of you is doing now.

57:29.000 --> 57:40.000
And in second, is there any way that you feel that your knowledge and expertise and that of others like you could be more fully utilized now and in the future?

57:44.000 --> 57:49.000
I'll tell you what, we'll go this way here saying, what are we doing now and then they'll start that way.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
What can we do in the future?

57:52.000 --> 58:00.000
What I'm doing right now is I literally did retire. I'm building an aerobatic by plane. It's essentially complete.

58:00.000 --> 58:12.000
I got final painting to do a hope to be flying at this December. I also have been doing air shows throughout the last two summers and a flight engineering position to be 17 with the Lunnstern.

58:13.000 --> 58:22.000
I took early retirement from NASA in 1986 and went on the last ten years I've been involved in the private sector and a number of different businesses.

58:22.000 --> 58:28.000
And I'm currently living up in the hill country up near Curville in the little town of Hunt.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
If any of you know where that is, we're all the camps are.

58:31.000 --> 58:37.000
But I'm still a consultant. I chair the board of a public company that is based in California.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
And I'm still in the executive search business, but please no resumes today.

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
I'm still in the aerospace business working for Grumman, a contractor here at JSC.

58:49.000 --> 58:55.000
And I hope to continue to be in the space business the rest of my life.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
The second part of the question.

58:58.000 --> 59:06.000
I might to come in on that. If you go over to the new control center here now and see what I call young kids operating over here.

59:08.000 --> 59:13.000
What they do, I feel real inadequate with what we did back in the old days.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
They have some real sharp people over there. They know what they're doing.

59:16.000 --> 59:22.000
And from a mission control standpoint, today NASA is in good hands.

59:24.000 --> 59:32.000
I'm still at NASA. I head up assistant engineering office where I still do engineering management and try to be mentors to young engineers coming up.

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
I'm still a youngster at 52. So I've got a lot of time here at the Johnson Space Center.

59:37.000 --> 59:42.000
I hope to serve that role to bring up the new programs that we are working on.

59:42.000 --> 59:47.000
Space Station Space Shuttle, me on as well as be mentors to new engineers.

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
I'd like to take a shot at that second question too.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
In Jerry hit part of it.

59:53.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I believe if all the good work that we did in Apollo, I think was important and I'm very proud of it.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But I think perhaps one of the best things or accomplishments we had was to leave a legacy to carry on in much the same way.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And when Jerry says the young people over in the control center today are a lot smarter basically than we are and we were.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I'm not sure they're any better, but they're a lot smarter.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
They're a lot smarter and they got better tools.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:33.000
But I think the thing that is best about it is that they have retained that decision making capability.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:42.000
As far as I can tell, management at the higher levels have not penetrated into it with the micro management fingers.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And I hope it stays that way.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
A lot of this had to do incidentally and reason I wanted to answer this for Gene did.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Gene had a lot to do with this.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Gene was all of our bosses.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
He started a trend.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:07.000
He and Chris Kraft working together in those years of the late 50s, early 60s, set a tone that has carried forward to today in mission operation.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Now I say he was always the boss.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I came back in 82 as the center director so I had him render me for a while.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
But I never did get control of him.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I really about two or three very quick thoughts there.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000
They talked about mission control and the motto they've got is Achievement through excellence.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And I believe it's this excellence which has allowed the people today to be as good possibly even better than they were in the past.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
So really they've got a standard of excellence they've set.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
The expectations they say are set on themselves.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Everybody up here understands the words we use discipline, morale, tough and competent.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Those are what we must be ourselves and that is what we expect others to be.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I think that is good and I think there's a legacy that's been passed on.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
We were very fortunate again to be brought up.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Chris Kraft we used to call the teacher for a very straightforward reason.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I remember the first day I ever stepped up to the flight director's job and he always had a hand over in there.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And I said Chris where's your hand over and there wasn't one.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
He says what do you want me to do?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
He says he's head set away.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
He says you're the flight director and he walks off council.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000
So I think there's that kind of a legacy from a standpoint of management that we really have to be careful.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Because if we're to be successful in space flight because space flight doesn't take a lot of second guessing.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And people got to respond very quickly.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
They have to be part of the game plan from the very beginning to the time they execute this thing.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:48.000
There is such thing as personal responsibility and accountability and that still must remain with the people.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:56.000
So if there's a message for the generation of managers we've got around here, you cannot corrupt the accountability and responsibility.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
It has to be in the hands of the people doing the job. That's it.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Let's give them all a big hand.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
That concludes our program for this afternoon.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
The open house will be shutting down at four o'clock so the facilities will be closing.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
But we're glad to have had you here today. We hope you've seen the pride that we have and the work that we do.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
There will be the balloons lifting off at six o'clock out by rocket park. Thank you.
