00:30.000 --> 00:34.800
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.080
I'm Tom Turbivill.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.560
This week and next week you will hear just part of the incredible story of service, the

00:41.560 --> 00:47.400
first Sergeant Jeffrey Bailey of Brian, a 20-year Army veteran who served overseas in Germany

00:47.400 --> 00:48.400
twice.

00:48.400 --> 00:55.920
In Korea and two tours of Vietnam, first with the 18th Army of Vietnam infantry and later

00:55.920 --> 00:57.640
with the 12th CAF.

00:57.640 --> 01:02.680
He was wounded during each Vietnam deployment, Ernie II Purple Hearts and the Silver Star,

01:02.680 --> 01:05.080
among many other awards and medals.

01:05.080 --> 01:09.520
Between his Vietnam tours, he served on the streets of South Side Chicago, helping to

01:09.520 --> 01:15.480
diffuse the devastating riots and the days following the April 4, 1968 assassination

01:15.480 --> 01:17.680
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.840
He also served three years at Fort Greley, Alaska on the edge of the Arctic Circle.

01:21.840 --> 01:27.160
As you can imagine, his is a remarkable story of service and we welcome Jeffrey Bailey

01:27.160 --> 01:28.640
to Veterans of the Valley.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.880
Jeffrey, thank you for being with us.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.360
It's an honor to know you and to talk to you.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.280
Let's get you into the service.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.400
I know you grew up in Bentley, just down the road.

01:37.400 --> 01:43.840
You graduated from high school in Hurrin in 1951 and entered the service in December of 1952,

01:43.840 --> 01:46.960
went to Fort Hood for your basic.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.000
First overseas deployment was Germany.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.400
Talk about that because you told me that Germany was a good place for the American soldier

01:53.400 --> 01:57.600
to be at this time because it was only eight years removed from World War II.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.600
Talk about that.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.600
Well, that's correct.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.160
It was a wonderful place to be.

02:03.160 --> 02:09.160
The beginning of a 20-year adventure for me.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.400
Most of it enjoyable.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.400
All of it a learning exercise.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.400
Exactly.

02:14.400 --> 02:21.400
I grew up in Bentley as you indicated on the family farm there.

02:21.400 --> 02:25.800
I grew up in high school graduating from Blackshire High School.

02:25.800 --> 02:38.200
In Germany, what you realize is that the emphasis in high school was placed on European history.

02:38.200 --> 02:46.560
So you know about the power of London in the nightlife of Paris and the artistry and

02:46.560 --> 02:48.280
so forth.

02:48.280 --> 02:55.800
So you're anxious to see these things that you have studied and read about.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.400
That made it an exciting thing.

02:58.400 --> 03:03.200
First of all, you get to live the experience you have been studying.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.080
But it was a great time to be there for several reasons.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.080
Number one was kind of economic.

03:08.080 --> 03:16.600
I think the ratio of marks per dollar was somewhere around 12 to 15 at that time.

03:16.600 --> 03:21.520
You could buy much more food and services with your money.

03:21.520 --> 03:31.200
But it was fairly close to World War II within the decade or the end of World War II.

03:31.200 --> 03:37.080
And it was amazing to see the devastation that is caused by war.

03:37.080 --> 03:44.600
And the German cities, manufacturing facilities were all totally destroyed.

03:44.600 --> 03:52.800
And it was my first time of seeing the female population of any country physically work

03:52.800 --> 03:55.120
doing a man's work.

03:55.120 --> 04:01.600
Rebuilding of the streets and infrastructure was the 80% of it by female.

04:01.600 --> 04:07.760
The place in the building of the streets, for example, the old streets primarily were

04:07.760 --> 04:11.520
of cobblestone like 6x6 square.

04:11.520 --> 04:19.440
And how women out there manhailing these cobblestone and laying them in place and physically

04:19.440 --> 04:20.440
doing the work.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.840
It was amazing.

04:21.840 --> 04:25.040
There were other advantages.

04:25.040 --> 04:31.520
As you know, we have just negotiated a status of force agreement with the Iraqis.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.400
We hadn't reached that point yet in Germany.

04:33.400 --> 04:38.320
At that time, the Germans were not allowed to be armed.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.160
They couldn't handle weapons.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.920
They couldn't arrest you.

04:41.920 --> 04:47.840
You were held accountable for your action, but not by the German courts, by the military.

04:47.840 --> 04:51.440
So it was kind of nice being there at that time.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.360
And indeed, you were an occupational force in Germany.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.360
We were an occupational army.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.360
That was your job.

04:56.360 --> 05:01.080
And you personally were heavy weapons infantry, mortar puttons.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.080
Mortar puttons.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.080
Mortars.

05:04.080 --> 05:12.280
On the 81 mortars initially and graduated to the 4 deuces, which is the biggest mortar

05:12.280 --> 05:20.240
that the army had, which is equivalent to 105 millimeter house in diameter and destruction

05:20.240 --> 05:22.120
just doesn't have quite the range.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.120
Right.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.840
And of course, the first infantry had been in Germany since 1941.

05:25.840 --> 05:29.520
But since the beginning of the U.S. involvement in the war.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.280
The first division into Germany.

05:32.280 --> 05:37.880
And the historic history you wouldn't believe.

05:37.880 --> 05:45.200
Just listening, if you expose to the history of the history of the first infantry division,

05:45.200 --> 05:48.280
you become a support of them.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.280
Right.

05:49.280 --> 05:55.160
You have the largest graveyards in France as an example.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.640
Had more people, they like to be first and everything.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.480
And they were first and death.

05:59.480 --> 06:00.480
Combat death.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.480
Exactly.

06:01.480 --> 06:05.960
First across the Rhine River infantry division, the first to breach the sick free line,

06:05.960 --> 06:09.800
the first to do all of these things.

06:09.800 --> 06:16.200
When I got there, the mission is impressed upon you in such a fashion that you don't forget

06:16.200 --> 06:22.200
it because the mission of the first infantry division at that time was to hold a line for

06:22.200 --> 06:24.160
one hour.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.880
That hour was to allow evacuation of civilians.

06:27.880 --> 06:34.240
That you would make your way on your own back south of the Rhine River.

06:34.240 --> 06:41.200
You left Germany, went back to the States, Fort Riley.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.320
Your enlistment was up in 1956.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.240
You got out, you re-enlisted.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.640
First armor, Fort Polk Louisiana.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.760
But I want to talk about your next really significant deployment.

06:51.760 --> 06:56.240
And that was to Alaska, where you went to Fort Greeley as part of the Cotton and Larmy

06:56.240 --> 06:57.240
Command.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.440
What do you think about what your duties were there?

06:58.440 --> 07:01.360
You tested everything for cold weather, right?

07:01.360 --> 07:02.360
Yes.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.600
I was with the Arctic Test Board.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.240
We came on the Cone Art Command, which was Cotton and Larmy Command.

07:08.240 --> 07:14.300
So that puts you up there on a fairly short list of chain of command between you and the

07:14.300 --> 07:17.000
Chief of Staff of the Army.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.880
And headquarters was in, I believe, in Fort Monroe, Virginia at that time.

07:23.880 --> 07:28.320
My job specifically was the mortar test in CO.

07:28.320 --> 07:33.720
I was in the mortar and test, more than chemical test section.

07:33.720 --> 07:39.920
And we tested all of the weapons for the mortars and the chemical weapons.

07:39.920 --> 07:40.920
Right.

07:40.920 --> 07:48.200
We did the cold weather test work on, as an example, the present day gas mass.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.600
I think they still used one with the two cheeks.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.600
Right.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.600
And the oldest.

07:52.600 --> 08:00.040
Prior to that, it had been the old mass with one kind of stone on the left cheek.

08:00.040 --> 08:08.160
We tested the new, we tested the ammunition for the four-douce mortar and the 81 mortar

08:08.160 --> 08:14.160
to give them increased range and more lethality.

08:14.160 --> 08:19.080
We also tested other equipment.

08:19.080 --> 08:23.520
We helped because you have to have ex-number of people doing things.

08:23.520 --> 08:28.880
We did work in conjunction with the quartermaster section on overwired boots.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.560
That's what we call them.

08:30.560 --> 08:36.680
You didn't even put them on if it was above 20 below zero.

08:36.680 --> 08:38.800
And they would keep your feet warm.

08:38.800 --> 08:46.120
We did an over-black boot that you wore if it was 20 percent in high end.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.880
That was exciting work.

08:47.880 --> 08:56.760
And finally, we did the work on the special weapon, the battalion commanders, the infantry

08:56.760 --> 09:02.280
battalion commander had accessibility to an atomic weapon.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.720
It was called the David Crocket.

09:05.720 --> 09:08.480
We didn't test the warhead.

09:08.480 --> 09:15.440
We only tested the delivery system and haul around the warhead for just for cold weather

09:15.440 --> 09:16.440
treatment.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.440
We didn't physically test the weapon.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.440
Right.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.240
It's been three years in Alaska, so you went through a...

09:21.240 --> 09:22.240
Yes, you were going to ask.

09:22.240 --> 09:28.360
There were one other significant incident that went on in Alaska while I was there.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.080
The Russians got to play it around and sent up their sputnik, which I failed to mention

09:32.080 --> 09:33.560
until you're the other day.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.640
And that got us all going and hiding it.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.240
I won't enough to remember that.

09:37.240 --> 09:41.520
They put that sputnik and orbit and that put us on an alert because we...

09:41.520 --> 09:47.960
A part of our alert procedures were when we have an alert of anything happen, the test

09:47.960 --> 09:51.640
system kind of ceased to exist.

09:51.640 --> 09:56.200
It became a second priority because our first mission was to man the do line.

09:56.200 --> 09:59.640
The early defense early warning system.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.840
So you're out there looking at the...

10:02.840 --> 10:05.720
You're taking a close look at that bird going on.

10:05.720 --> 10:09.400
In Alaska for three years, so you spent a lot of summers and winters in Alaska.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.000
So you got the full force of it all, right?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Got the full force of it.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.920
You need to move on.

10:13.920 --> 10:14.920
You came back.

10:14.920 --> 10:21.240
You were at Fort Benning, US Army instructor training school from the summers of 62 to 65.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.600
And then back to Germany again.

10:23.600 --> 10:29.200
Quickly what was your job the next time when you went back to Germany for one year?

10:29.200 --> 10:31.920
I went back as a...

10:31.920 --> 10:37.640
Mortar David Crockett for tomb sergeant controlling the same weapons that I had been teaching

10:37.640 --> 10:41.240
and bending and doing test work on in Alaska.

10:41.240 --> 10:45.400
There was one significant incident that occurred while I was at Benning.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.440
We lost John F. Kennedy.

10:47.440 --> 10:53.400
That got our heart pumping because everybody prepared the stage and invasion from mainland

10:53.400 --> 10:56.560
US along the Gulf Coast.

10:56.880 --> 10:59.080
We went back to Germany.

10:59.080 --> 11:02.880
This time we went down in the folder gap.

11:02.880 --> 11:08.560
The historic invasion route of everybody into Germany.

11:08.560 --> 11:12.320
That's where we spent time for a year until...

11:12.320 --> 11:14.320
As you said, eyeball with the Russians.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.480
With the Russians.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.120
They always seem to be there.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.520
They always seem to be there.

11:20.560 --> 11:27.600
And then back to the United States, Fort Bragg, military assistance advisory school for 12 weeks.

11:27.600 --> 11:31.120
Where the emphasis you said you knew where you were headed because the emphasis there was

11:31.120 --> 11:34.840
on physical conditioning and learning the Vietnamese language.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.840
That's correct.

11:36.840 --> 11:41.680
You knew that when you got your orders probably five months earlier, six months early.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.120
They said Vietnam.

11:43.120 --> 11:48.200
This is just a stop and transit to prepare you for that mission.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.160
We did the 12 weeks there.

11:51.160 --> 11:55.040
And once again, the emphasis is on language and physical condition.

11:55.040 --> 11:59.360
And you found that you pretty well needed them both.

11:59.360 --> 12:05.280
10th Armored Vietnam, August of 1966 was the first time that you arrived in country.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.640
Things were really heating up about Ben.

12:07.640 --> 12:14.160
Talk about your unit, what your duty was in Vietnam.

12:14.200 --> 12:19.600
And lead us, go ahead and lead us on to the incidents whereby you received your first purple heart.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.840
I was assigned to the...

12:22.840 --> 12:23.840
It's a funny thing.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.920
I was assigned to what at the time was the 10th Arm Division.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.680
And then the Vietnamese Ling Goal...

12:30.680 --> 12:32.720
I said Armored, I meant Armored.

12:32.720 --> 12:33.720
Yes.

12:33.720 --> 12:38.080
But in the Vietnamese Ling Goal, the number 10 is a low number.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.040
Number one is the best with 10 being the worst.

12:41.080 --> 12:46.720
And the 10th Armored Division, the infantry division, they changed the name to the 18th.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.920
Well, that reason only.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.680
So, you know, it didn't get discredited.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.720
It didn't give you the wrong connotation.

12:53.720 --> 12:59.920
But when I went in there initially, we were sitting in the database of Black Virgin Mountain.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.200
Well, several miles away from it.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.840
And the garden is a little village.

13:05.880 --> 13:16.680
And what strikes you initially when you go in country is that the population has been removed from the countryside into the city.

13:16.680 --> 13:19.000
It because the war has caused this.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.600
So, everything out there other than a village that you know is occupied is kind of a free fazon.

13:24.600 --> 13:30.080
We were sitting down here guarding this little village, probably about 5,000 people.

13:30.080 --> 13:35.040
And we ran patrols and who are not out of that place.

13:35.040 --> 13:39.880
Until we had an incident up at another location.

13:39.880 --> 13:48.960
Because that location was down at the edge of the rubber plantation on highway one.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.640
We had up at Vosu.

13:51.640 --> 14:00.040
We had a part of the infantry division of Italian that we got over ran to make the story short.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.360
And we had to get out and go up there.

14:03.360 --> 14:13.360
Now, as an advisor with an infantry battalion, you live and eat and live and die with those people.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.720
That is your unit.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.800
So, we had to walk 75 Ks.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.840
We took us about three days and we arrived up there.

14:21.840 --> 14:26.240
And found that the units had been totally decimated out of 1,000.

14:26.240 --> 14:33.080
People that was only 11 of them left survived.

14:33.120 --> 14:39.760
With the Arvins, you had a four man advisory team, two officers and two enlisted.

14:39.760 --> 14:46.960
Only one man was left out of that four man team and it was an enlisted person who had suffered a chest wound,

14:46.960 --> 14:49.200
destroyed part of his lung.

14:49.200 --> 14:56.680
And he had been injured for three days landing in what amounts to his usual ditch there.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.920
But he survived.

14:58.960 --> 15:05.920
And of course, we were greeted with messages in the village posted on the bulletin board by the Arvins unit,

15:05.920 --> 15:12.520
by the NBA unit that over ran them and killed them all and said that they had awaited us.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.560
Fortunately, it didn't occur.

15:15.560 --> 15:28.160
And the attempt to make it occur, we got a dessert in who was the regimental exo

15:28.200 --> 15:34.120
of that attacking unit and he gave us the information that they were going to attack in about three days,

15:34.120 --> 15:36.680
gave us the total order of battle, everything.

15:36.680 --> 15:43.880
So, we were prepared for them and kind of took care of business, made short work over.

15:43.880 --> 15:51.720
And they posted notices on the village board that they would be back.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.800
We owed them a debt in blood and all that.

15:54.800 --> 16:00.360
You told me that they even produced a list with names on it and your name was on the list.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.760
That's right.

16:01.760 --> 16:05.160
All of the advises, only three of us at that time.

16:05.160 --> 16:16.240
It's two officers in my cell and all three of our names were on there in various pester awards for your head.

16:16.240 --> 16:22.200
Their next attack wasn't quite as bold as the last one because on the first one,

16:22.200 --> 16:26.440
they just attacked and mass which was kind of unusual.

16:26.440 --> 16:34.400
But on the next one, they sit back and mortar this and that's where I received my purple heart first time was in a mortar attack.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.600
Right. It was about a month after the first attack.

16:36.600 --> 16:37.920
About a month.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
Yes.

16:38.920 --> 16:45.320
And see, at Vosu, that was a village and it was occupied.

16:45.320 --> 16:50.760
That's where they go to mark and post it, propaganda lists.

16:50.760 --> 16:58.040
The load art was like 4,000 kilometers away and it was unoccupied.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.400
We patrolled it regularly.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.720
There were no human beings living there.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.080
And that's where the attack came from.

17:04.080 --> 17:07.160
The mortar attack initially started from there.

17:07.160 --> 17:14.720
And then that one attack, we lost the senior advisor, a captain from Massachusetts.

17:14.720 --> 17:28.160
And we lost the junior officer advisor with a severe leg wound and they gave me a little present,

17:28.160 --> 17:30.840
I guess I carry for the rest of my life.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.640
I still retain some of the fragments.

17:32.640 --> 17:33.760
You caught some shrapnel, right?

17:33.760 --> 17:34.760
Oh, yes.

17:34.760 --> 17:35.760
Yes.

17:35.760 --> 17:40.360
In my arm, in my hand and in the right side of my body.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.520
They removed all that on the right side of my body.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.080
That I still carry is really in the palm of my hand.

17:46.080 --> 17:51.320
In America having the best doctors, he said, he says, I can take it out.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.760
But you will, I'll do more damage to the hand.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.040
Leave it in there, yourself, or no effect for.

17:57.040 --> 18:00.760
And that was in 1967.

18:00.760 --> 18:04.040
And I haven't had a day's pain with it yet.

18:04.040 --> 18:08.960
Periodically, about once every two or three years, the VA will X-ray it to see if it's moving

18:08.960 --> 18:12.160
because it's located right under those two veins, right there.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.160
This is just kind of steady.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.760
1967, you were 35 years old.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.760
That would be right.

18:18.760 --> 18:19.760
October.

18:19.760 --> 18:20.760
Still a young man.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.760
Yes, yes.

18:21.760 --> 18:28.120
Were you, and we didn't talk about this the other day, but being in that situation, being

18:28.120 --> 18:32.160
in the firefight, what were your thoughts?

18:32.160 --> 18:35.840
World War II veterans tell me all the time their thoughts were, just do your job.

18:35.840 --> 18:36.840
Do your job and survive.

18:36.840 --> 18:37.840
Is that what your thoughts were?

18:37.840 --> 18:38.840
That's where you're scary?

18:38.840 --> 18:39.840
No.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.440
You don't have time to get scared.

18:43.440 --> 18:47.040
And that's basically what happens.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.240
Your training kicks in.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.120
And you take it from there.

18:51.120 --> 18:55.160
And like you say, I was 35 years old.

18:55.160 --> 19:02.200
The draft at that time was from 19 to 26, I believe.

19:02.200 --> 19:09.760
And the difference is, I have spent 10, 12 years in preparation for this moment.

19:09.760 --> 19:16.200
So you just automatically, you believe so much in your training.

19:16.200 --> 19:21.240
And if you didn't want to be there, you wouldn't, of course, you had ample opportunities

19:21.240 --> 19:23.200
to get out.

19:23.200 --> 19:28.720
So you just kind of go on automatic pilot, like the pilot that landed at that plane in

19:28.720 --> 19:29.720
the Hudson River.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.240
And other day, he didn't do a lot of thinking.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.960
It's just kind of automatically do your job.

19:33.960 --> 19:34.960
Right.

19:34.960 --> 19:39.120
And you will find at that time, you will actually,

19:40.120 --> 19:45.000
in the middle of a five, like you sometimes think that, now what the hell am I doing here?

19:45.000 --> 19:48.360
And why am I not afraid?

19:48.360 --> 19:51.400
Because your training takes over.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.600
You don't do stupid things.

19:53.600 --> 19:57.160
You don't run standing straight up if they're shooting at you.

19:57.160 --> 20:00.680
But you really don't get time to be afraid.

20:00.680 --> 20:06.960
Now, when it's all over 30 minutes later, and you're sitting on smoking your first cigarette,

20:06.960 --> 20:10.320
you might not be able to stand back up.

20:10.320 --> 20:15.440
It's a great analogy about the pilot landing in the Hudson.

20:15.440 --> 20:19.600
Let's look at some pictures here real quick of some of the things that you talked about

20:19.600 --> 20:25.360
in some pictures of the young soldier, Jeffrey Bailey.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.240
When was that taken?

20:27.240 --> 20:32.920
That would have been in 1967, I believe.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.640
So that would have been after your first tour in the four years.

20:35.640 --> 20:36.920
It was in between tours.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.600
Yeah, before your second tour of the year.

20:38.600 --> 20:43.200
It was even before...

20:43.200 --> 20:44.360
Before the Chicago.

20:44.360 --> 20:45.200
Before Chicago.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.320
Right, which we'll be talking about next show.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.120
Okay, let's move on.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.480
That one is much earlier.

20:52.480 --> 20:56.840
That's going to be in the late 50s.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.920
Came out of Alaska in 59, so it's going to be in 59 or 60.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.960
You would receive expert marksman?

21:02.960 --> 21:03.960
That's right.

21:03.960 --> 21:04.960
Sightations.

21:04.960 --> 21:05.960
That's right.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.800
Now, talk about this.

21:08.800 --> 21:14.160
This was during a training exercise, and that's you in the buggy there.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.040
This was just sort of a training exercise.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.400
That's a training day.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.240
That's an organizational day.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.240
It's like the birth theory of the organization.

21:22.240 --> 21:27.520
It's really a training day where everybody takes off because after this, there's the beer

21:27.520 --> 21:29.520
and the food.

21:29.520 --> 21:30.520
That's right.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.520
That's right.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.520
That's the Fort Hood, Texas.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.480
That's the first sergeant race.

21:34.480 --> 21:38.920
See, all of the first sergeants are being pulled by three people from their unit.

21:38.920 --> 21:40.280
Okay, so this one is training.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.280
This was field day.

21:42.280 --> 21:44.120
This is an athletic event day.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.120
I see.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.120
Okay.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.120
And we wanted to race, by the way.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.120
Okay.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.400
And you were serious about it because this next one shows that you're back there like

21:51.400 --> 21:55.400
you're riding a buck and Bronco, and there you got your horses there in front of you.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.400
And they were good.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.400
Yeah.

21:57.400 --> 22:01.580
That particular day, we don't have any pitches of it, but we had the staff, the battalion

22:01.580 --> 22:07.880
commander, XO and one, two, three, four, the staff officer pulling against the first

22:07.880 --> 22:13.380
sergeants and selected for tunes like on a rope pool.

22:13.380 --> 22:18.380
And while you dragged the other through the mud, we drove those officers right through

22:18.380 --> 22:19.380
the mud.

22:19.380 --> 22:23.020
Oh, I get this.

22:23.020 --> 22:24.020
Let's go.

22:24.020 --> 22:25.940
We got one more picture.

22:25.940 --> 22:29.420
You had talked about the Black Virgin Mountain.

22:29.420 --> 22:31.940
New about then, the Black Virgin Mountain.

22:31.940 --> 22:36.220
I found this picture on the internet of the Black Virgin Mountain talking about what

22:36.220 --> 22:38.020
we're looking at there.

22:38.020 --> 22:41.580
Well, it speaks for itself except for one thing.

22:41.580 --> 22:45.620
The very top of it was secured by the Army Security Agents.

22:45.620 --> 22:52.100
And this is always one of our secret intelligence gathering people.

22:52.100 --> 22:58.620
They listen to all of the enemy traffic and electronic ease dropping out, mostly.

22:58.620 --> 23:00.660
And for us, I know them.

23:00.660 --> 23:04.260
But they occupied the top of the mountain with their security.

23:04.260 --> 23:08.540
The middle part of the mountain was occupied by the enemy forces.

23:08.540 --> 23:11.660
And the bottom part was occupied by American forces.

23:11.660 --> 23:14.660
So what are we looking at there at the base of the mountain right there in front?

23:14.660 --> 23:15.660
That's a base camp.

23:15.660 --> 23:16.660
That's a base camp.

23:16.660 --> 23:17.660
I'm not sure who it is.

23:17.660 --> 23:18.660
Right.

23:18.660 --> 23:23.100
Like I said, we were like maybe 15, 20 miles away from it.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.100
Right.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.100
Right.

23:25.100 --> 23:28.580
But on top of that mountain, you could see for a long way because you're talking about

23:28.580 --> 23:30.900
a mountain just raising up in the middle of the flat.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.220
That's exactly right.

23:32.220 --> 23:37.140
Because actually you're getting on toward the Delta, toward the flat race growing country

23:37.140 --> 23:38.340
down.

23:38.340 --> 23:44.860
And if there's a military advantage in holding high ground, they've got it.

23:44.860 --> 23:47.940
They've got it.

23:47.940 --> 23:53.340
You said that sort of a unique part of your service was that you served in every active

23:53.340 --> 23:56.380
armored division in your 20 years of service.

23:56.380 --> 23:57.380
Talk about that.

23:57.380 --> 24:04.900
Every active armored division, first armored division, old line side, the second armored

24:04.900 --> 24:10.220
division, Hell on Wheels, the third armored division, spearhead division.

24:10.220 --> 24:15.580
And I don't know why they call, I don't know why, what the fourth armored division's

24:15.580 --> 24:16.580
motto was.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.580
I simply don't know.

24:17.580 --> 24:21.060
I don't know if they had one.

24:21.060 --> 24:24.300
But I served it all on four.

24:24.300 --> 24:30.020
And then I never got higher than one in a miracle order in any other division.

24:30.020 --> 24:38.060
First, the infantry division, first care division, fourth armored division, and three preceding.

24:38.060 --> 24:43.060
And every one of those armored division, like I said, has a slogan.

24:43.060 --> 24:48.860
The first armored old line side was Padden's nickname.

24:48.860 --> 24:52.940
The Hell on Wheels thing was another one of his gimmicks.

24:52.940 --> 24:55.460
The spearhead division was Eisenhower's thing.

24:55.460 --> 25:03.940
Because he liked the spearhead as a text with the armor of the spearhead division, the

25:03.940 --> 25:05.740
third armored division.

25:05.740 --> 25:06.740
Exactly.

25:06.740 --> 25:13.860
But when you left me at the arm after your first tour, did you have a feeling that you

25:13.860 --> 25:15.860
would be back?

25:15.860 --> 25:23.300
I really didn't at that time, not that I recall, because we were talking about getting out

25:23.300 --> 25:27.220
of there in 1967.

25:27.220 --> 25:33.540
And we had been in there for a number of years in back 64, 65.

25:33.540 --> 25:37.660
But I figured that there was always that chance.

25:37.660 --> 25:41.380
And I wasn't about to volunteer to go back.

25:41.380 --> 25:46.140
My wife will not believe that I didn't volunteer to go to Vietnam the first time.

25:46.140 --> 25:48.140
Well I did, but they refused it.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.140
Right.

25:49.140 --> 25:50.140
And sent me to Germany.

25:50.140 --> 25:51.740
I didn't volunteer the second time.

25:51.740 --> 25:55.780
They said he wanted to go then Wilson and I.

25:55.780 --> 26:00.220
You and your wife have been married for some 53 years.

26:00.220 --> 26:01.220
53 years?

26:01.220 --> 26:02.220
53 years.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.380
She's been along for the right.

26:04.380 --> 26:06.420
She's been along for it.

26:06.420 --> 26:11.940
And a military wife, especially one that sees her husband go off to Vietnam twice.

26:11.940 --> 26:12.940
Yes.

26:12.940 --> 26:14.900
It takes special person.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.900
It does.

26:16.900 --> 26:21.340
And you have to have a lot of respect for these people.

26:21.340 --> 26:23.020
And they demanded and they get it.

26:23.020 --> 26:29.300
Because first of all, if you're out of their life as the primary breadwinner or the controlling

26:29.300 --> 26:35.780
force you to head of the family for a year, and they get along just fine without you

26:35.780 --> 26:40.900
supervision or authority or cooperation, you have to kind of do some adjustments when

26:40.900 --> 26:41.900
you get back.

26:41.900 --> 26:42.900
Right.

26:42.900 --> 26:47.220
Next week we're going to talk about two other aspects of your service.

26:47.220 --> 26:51.460
Your service as we mentioned in the streets of South Side Chicago.

26:51.460 --> 26:54.940
And we're going to talk about your second tour of Vietnam and what you've been doing since

26:54.940 --> 26:58.140
1973 when you retired from the military.

26:58.140 --> 27:02.980
But you came back after your first tour of Vietnam and back to Fort Hood, is that right?

27:02.980 --> 27:04.940
Back to Fort Hood.

27:04.940 --> 27:08.660
We came back to Fort Hood once again.

27:08.660 --> 27:17.820
During the first Army Division, an old unit I'd been in before, out of four trips to Fort

27:17.820 --> 27:24.660
Hood and one in Louisiana with the first Army Division, I only served in two units.

27:24.660 --> 27:28.740
One with the 634th Army of the Infantry Battalion.

27:28.740 --> 27:34.740
All the rest of them was with this one infantry battalion.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.980
That's a twice the same company.

27:36.980 --> 27:39.140
So it was like my home away from home.

27:39.140 --> 27:41.740
Yeah, you told me you had five tours with the first Army Division.

27:41.740 --> 27:42.740
That's right.

27:42.740 --> 27:43.740
That's right.

27:43.740 --> 27:44.740
Fort Hood.

27:44.740 --> 27:45.740
You got to know them well.

27:45.740 --> 27:46.740
Got to know them.

27:46.740 --> 27:54.740
