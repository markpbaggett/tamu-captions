00:00.000 --> 00:08.200
In 1987, the International Space University was founded to develop and implement international

00:08.200 --> 00:10.720
space-related curriculum.

00:10.720 --> 00:15.360
This university would identify, assemble, and educate a new generation of young leaders

00:15.360 --> 00:17.000
from around the world.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.360
By uniting these students in an intensive program of study and research, ISU would foster

00:22.360 --> 00:27.840
long-lasting ties between these future heads of industry, government, and academia, creating

00:27.840 --> 00:33.680
an international network, which would help assure cooperation in the opening of space.

00:33.680 --> 00:39.960
In the summer of 1988, that mission was accomplished, and the International Space University

00:39.960 --> 00:42.200
was born.

00:42.200 --> 00:48.360
For the first summer session of the International Space University, 104 of the world's top graduate

00:48.360 --> 00:53.400
level students from 21 nations came together on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute

00:53.400 --> 00:55.680
of Technology.

00:55.680 --> 01:00.720
Having undergone a rigorous selection program, these students participated in an experience

01:00.720 --> 01:05.720
that would change their lives and quite possibly the world forever.

01:05.720 --> 01:10.640
So what we are going to talk about, and what you are going to listen to, and what you are

01:10.640 --> 01:17.000
going to take part in in the next ten weeks, is much more important than just a learning

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
experience.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.120
It is a creative experience.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.280
You are creating your future.

01:24.280 --> 01:30.400
There is nothing more important because in your future lies the history and the future

01:30.400 --> 01:32.480
of the human species.

01:32.480 --> 01:39.200
The ISU class of 88 is going to be a major component in the space leadership of the world

01:39.200 --> 01:40.200
in the future.

01:40.200 --> 01:46.160
These are impressive young professionals with a formidable list of credentials to their

01:46.160 --> 01:47.160
credit.

01:47.160 --> 01:53.680
They are gifted with enormous intelligence and unbelievable resources of energy.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.320
For over 60 days and nights, these students were immersed in one of the most rigorous

01:58.320 --> 02:02.440
and intensive space education programs ever organized.

02:02.440 --> 02:07.640
From the world's space powers to those nations only now on the threshold of utilizing space

02:07.640 --> 02:12.280
technology, ISU has something to offer everyone.

02:12.280 --> 02:18.080
The whole process involves all the training, involves a look at all communication technologies

02:18.080 --> 02:26.640
and using satellites for remote sensing, monitoring the growth of forests or the spread of forests

02:26.640 --> 02:28.120
all over the place.

02:28.120 --> 02:33.720
And in my country, this is one of the technology we require and we will use this to implement

02:33.720 --> 02:34.720
these facilities.

02:34.720 --> 02:39.840
I had a few ideas about space and what that space means.

02:39.840 --> 02:47.280
But when I came here to ISU and after the completion of this program, two month intensive program,

02:47.280 --> 02:52.400
I can say that I learned a lot during this program.

02:52.400 --> 02:58.440
Including 240 hours of lectures and instruction by leading experts from 14 nations, students

02:58.440 --> 03:04.320
are exposed to the latest ideas in all fields of space development, exploration, technology

03:04.320 --> 03:06.760
and administration.

03:06.760 --> 03:12.000
Stressing a multidisciplinary approach to education, ISU has developed courses in the following

03:12.000 --> 03:14.400
eight departments of space studies.

03:14.400 --> 03:21.640
Architecture, business and management, engineering, life sciences, policy and law, resources

03:21.640 --> 03:27.120
and manufacturing, satellite applications, physical sciences.

03:27.120 --> 03:31.120
The quality of the lectures we've had here has been just superb.

03:31.120 --> 03:35.800
We've had experts in space business, for example, the chief designer of the shuttle.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.920
Siderootensinus come in, but he is now president of Rockwell Space Transportation Systems

03:39.920 --> 03:45.640
and he has talked to us about what it means to be involved in space business, what better

03:45.640 --> 03:47.040
perspective could you have?

03:47.040 --> 03:53.240
If we met the best in the field, I mean professional wise and much of those wise, and we saw

03:53.240 --> 03:59.360
insight or view that we never could see it from school or from anywhere else.

03:59.360 --> 04:05.480
Normally confined to one or two areas of specialization, ISU students are taught the importance

04:05.480 --> 04:11.920
of broad-based knowledge, developing the skills necessary to effectively work in a multidisciplinary

04:11.920 --> 04:13.320
environment.

04:13.320 --> 04:19.680
To accomplish this goal, each session students work on a simulation of a major space project.

04:19.680 --> 04:25.800
During the 1988 session, they spent over 280 hours working with interdisciplinary teams,

04:25.800 --> 04:31.120
which planned and designed a viable lunar base for research and industry.

04:31.120 --> 04:38.400
Students on experiments such as this one are vital to giving students and faculty a feel

04:38.400 --> 04:42.920
for the real problems that are involved in space operations.

04:42.920 --> 04:47.840
And no student who has operated the system will be able to have any doubts about whether

04:47.840 --> 04:51.200
or not it's possible to control machinery in real time on the moon.

04:51.200 --> 04:58.480
The multidisciplinary approach that this program took has been a real eye opener.

04:58.480 --> 05:03.840
ISU students represent a global network of expertise and talent, a benefit which is

05:03.840 --> 05:07.400
of extreme importance in this global economy.

05:07.400 --> 05:14.080
What's important is the experience of getting to know other people, getting a common base.

05:14.080 --> 05:20.160
You know the people when you have to talk to them in the future, and everything's going

05:20.160 --> 05:25.520
to be so much easier when you can negotiate with friends than with people you've never

05:25.520 --> 05:26.520
met before.

05:26.520 --> 05:34.320
So it needs a lot of international collaboration in the future to establish a space station

05:34.320 --> 05:35.840
with lunar base.

05:35.840 --> 05:42.640
What I will go away with is a base of contacts with the world, people who are at my age,

05:42.640 --> 05:47.240
or approximately my age, or my motivation are interested in the things that I'm interested

05:47.240 --> 05:50.080
in, and that is an incredible bond to have.

05:50.080 --> 05:58.560
ISU is going to be the training ground for those savvy individuals who know how to operate

05:58.560 --> 06:05.440
in this world marketplace, and know how to cut across the boundaries of governments and

06:05.440 --> 06:11.200
corporations, pull together projects and programs, and make them work.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.920
ISU is looking to the future, and that future is bright.

06:15.920 --> 06:20.960
After four more summer sessions hosted at the world's greatest educational institutions,

06:20.960 --> 06:26.920
ISU will open the doors on its first permanent campus during the International Space Year

06:26.920 --> 06:30.040
1992.

06:30.040 --> 06:35.640
From this central campus, ISU will beam lectures and teleconferences to advance students and

06:35.640 --> 06:39.520
researchers at daughter campuses around the world.

06:39.520 --> 06:45.160
The goal of ISU is to become the first true space university at the dawn of the 21st

06:45.160 --> 06:50.760
century, with students and faculty actually studying and working in space.

06:50.760 --> 06:56.440
I think the ISU concept as well as other concepts like this is an absolute seedbed to spring

06:56.440 --> 06:59.600
new ideas and innovation into our total process.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.560
The ISU is building international bridges.

07:03.560 --> 07:07.080
To move out into space is going to be very, very expensive, and I think if we're going

07:07.080 --> 07:11.000
to do it seriously, we're going to have to do it as an international endeavor.

07:11.000 --> 07:19.360
And I think the ISU plants the seeds of international cooperation and demonstrates the benefits to

07:19.360 --> 07:23.120
its student body, and that can only be to the good in the long run.

07:23.120 --> 07:29.680
Space is going to invade all the areas of our being in the next 20 or 30 years, and it's

07:29.680 --> 07:34.800
in everybody's interest to make sure that it's there, it's free, it's international,

07:34.800 --> 07:35.800
and it's forward-looking.

07:35.800 --> 07:40.120
If I had any money, I would put it in.

07:40.120 --> 07:45.040
Dozens of space organizations and sponsors have stepped forward to support the ISU dream

07:45.040 --> 07:50.520
of a new worldwide network of young leaders who have the capabilities and drive to push

07:50.520 --> 07:55.880
their nations and companies into leading roles as we enter the 21st century.

07:55.880 --> 08:01.000
These visionary sponsors see the international space university as the important investment

08:01.000 --> 08:03.400
that it is.

08:03.400 --> 08:10.680
By supporting an ISU student today, they are creating a leader for tomorrow.

08:10.680 --> 08:15.160
As the people of Earth take their first steps outward into the solar system, we are faced

08:15.160 --> 08:16.160
with a choice.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.560
Do we do it alone?

08:18.560 --> 08:19.560
Or together?

08:19.560 --> 08:25.840
When we carry on as we have for thousands of years, or do we try something new?

08:25.840 --> 08:30.640
The students of the International Space University are ready to accept the challenge of tomorrow

08:30.640 --> 08:31.640
now.

08:31.640 --> 08:34.560
Together, we can reach the stars.

15:32.640 --> 15:39.640
TheCheers

15:39.640 --> 15:43.600
of Galaxy

15:43.600 --> 15:45.800
Friends

15:46.000 --> 15:47.800
your

15:49.200 --> 15:51.200
Bitcoin

15:52.400 --> 15:53.660
K Citizens

16:12.960 --> 16:14.340
ready

16:14.340 --> 16:23.060
Greetings to all you gathered for the first graduation ceremony of the International Space

16:23.060 --> 16:31.460
University. I send a specially warm wishes to my colleagues at MIT, my old friend Roy Gibson,

16:31.460 --> 16:39.860
and the men behind the ISU, Peter Diamantis, Todd Hawley, Bob Richards, and their colleagues.

16:39.860 --> 16:44.340
I particularly pleased that I can greet you while remaining comforted home on the other side

16:44.340 --> 16:51.060
of the earth. I never really expected the commsats would be so useful to me personally. In fact,

16:51.060 --> 16:58.100
I never expected to see them in my lifetime. You were the first representatives of a true

16:58.100 --> 17:05.140
space-faring species whose world is not bounded by the confines of one planet. So let me share

17:05.140 --> 17:14.100
with you a passage I wrote like in 1969 for the history of the Apollo 11 mission, first on the moon.

17:16.660 --> 17:25.460
Half a billion years ago, the moon summoned life out of its first home, the sea, and that is on the empty

17:25.460 --> 17:32.740
land. For as it drew the tides across the barren continents of primeval earth, their deity rhythm

17:32.740 --> 17:39.940
exposed to the sun and air, the creatures of the shadows, most perished, but some adapted to

17:39.940 --> 17:47.700
the new and hostile environment that contrasted to the land had begun. We shall never know when this

17:47.700 --> 17:53.940
happened on the shores of what vanished sea. There were no eyes or cameras to record the event.

17:55.220 --> 18:01.460
Now the moon calls again, and this time life responds to the roar that shakes the sky.

18:02.820 --> 18:10.260
When a Saturn 5 soars space words on 4,000 tons of thrust, it signifies more than a triumph of

18:10.260 --> 18:20.100
technology. It opens the next chapter of evolution. Well, that was written in 1969, and we're going

18:20.100 --> 18:26.260
to return to the moon. But when we go there again, it will be in vehicles that will make the Saturn

18:26.260 --> 18:31.300
5 for all its staggering complexity and its 150 million horsepower,

18:32.020 --> 18:39.460
it looks like a clumsy, inefficient dinosaur of the early space age. And this time we will stay.

18:42.260 --> 18:49.380
The space travel is a technological mutation that already should not arrive until the 21st century.

18:50.180 --> 18:56.580
But thanks to the ambition and genius of men like Werner von Braun and Sergei Korol,

18:57.540 --> 19:04.100
and their influence upon such diverse individuals as Kennedy and Kurschtoff, the moon was reached

19:04.820 --> 19:11.380
half a century ahead of time. And now you can take advantage of this historical accident.

19:12.340 --> 19:17.700
Korol has I Newton once remarked, you are standing on the shoulders of giants.

19:20.180 --> 19:24.180
The moon was a fitting subject for our efforts during the first session of the ISU.

19:25.860 --> 19:32.260
Do not lose the momentum of your work or the intensity of your vision, whatever obstacles you may

19:32.260 --> 19:39.860
encounter. As H.T. Wells once put it, the choice is universe or nothing.

19:41.860 --> 19:46.180
The resources of that universe are by all human standards infinite.

19:47.780 --> 19:56.100
There are no limits to growth among the stars. Unfortunately, there's a tragic mismatched

19:56.100 --> 20:02.500
between our present needs and our capabilities. The conquers of space will not arrive

20:02.500 --> 20:10.500
soon enough to save millions from needing starved and stunted lives. Thus it is all the more urgent

20:10.500 --> 20:15.540
that we exploit to the utmost. The marvelous tools that space technology has already given us,

20:16.420 --> 20:24.260
commsats, weather sats, geosats, earth resources sats, and all the other sats yet to be invented.

20:25.380 --> 20:31.700
And this is the reason, as I've said many times in the past, that the third world needs space

20:31.700 --> 20:35.540
technology even more urgently than the so-called developing world.

20:39.220 --> 20:43.860
You will find the years to come that the experience which you have shared with your fellow ISU

20:43.860 --> 20:50.340
students would have changed your life. To work with friends from a score of other nations

20:50.340 --> 20:56.340
who profoundly affect your worldview, and that may well be the most important role of the ISU.

20:57.060 --> 21:04.900
As our terrestrial universities once first flourished during the times of great exploration and discovery

21:04.900 --> 21:11.140
on our own planet, so the ISU is a response to the first exploration of space.

21:11.140 --> 21:19.540
The blossoming art and science during the Renaissance may now be repeated in artists and poets

21:20.020 --> 21:28.660
join scientists and engineers at the New Frontier. As the university begins its second year in Europe,

21:29.300 --> 21:34.660
and later in other locations around the globe, I eagerly await its growth to a permanent

21:35.220 --> 21:39.300
full-time institution which will train tomorrow's space professionals.

21:41.780 --> 21:46.420
I would like to know the future that you will help to create, but that is a privilege to be

21:46.420 --> 21:53.060
reserved for your children and grandchildren. It is they who, who could H.T. Wells again,

21:53.780 --> 22:00.740
shall stand upon this earth as one stands upon a footstool and wreak head their hand among the stars.

22:02.820 --> 22:07.140
I wish you well for your represent a new evolutionary brought to humanity.

22:08.180 --> 22:14.660
Congratulations on your achievement and my very best wishes for your futures in space.

22:14.660 --> 22:23.220
Thank you and goodbye.
