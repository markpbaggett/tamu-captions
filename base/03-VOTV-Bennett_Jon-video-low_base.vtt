00:30.000 --> 00:38.840
Hello and welcome to this special edition of Veterans of the Valley.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.600
I'm Tom Turbiville.

00:40.600 --> 00:45.120
And I'm John Bennett, station manager and program director for KAMU TV.

00:45.120 --> 00:49.800
It was March 1st, 2005 that right here in this studio we take our very first episode of

00:49.800 --> 00:51.360
Veterans of the Valley.

00:51.360 --> 00:55.960
And at that time we've had the honor to share with you the stories of many military veterans

00:55.960 --> 00:58.560
from right here in the Brasis Valley.

00:58.560 --> 01:04.460
This is our 145th original episode of Veterans of the Valley that KAMU has aired in those

01:04.460 --> 01:06.140
five plus years.

01:06.140 --> 01:10.500
We've heard in their own words the remarkable stories of service of veterans who have

01:10.500 --> 01:14.360
served in World War II and every war since then.

01:14.360 --> 01:18.880
But today Tom and I will reflect on the show how I got started, some of the more memorable

01:18.880 --> 01:24.320
of those 145 and the impact that you have told us Veterans of the Valley has had on our

01:24.320 --> 01:26.760
community in the tourist five years.

01:26.760 --> 01:30.380
We're not trying to pat ourselves on the back job but more really sort of give tribute

01:30.380 --> 01:36.640
to the over 140 veterans who have sat in that chair that have told us their story.

01:36.640 --> 01:40.800
It's really been remarkable and like you said the impact that it's had in the community

01:40.800 --> 01:45.900
because you and I hear every week from people about boy I like that show or really like

01:45.900 --> 01:50.080
that show or I'll tell you somebody you've got to interview it really sort of has had

01:50.080 --> 01:51.080
a far reaching effect.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.360
There's not a week that goes by Tom and we don't get a call or somebody on the street

01:55.360 --> 02:00.160
says something about being on the show, liking the show, loving the show, wins the show

02:00.160 --> 02:01.160
coming on.

02:01.160 --> 02:03.920
Tom does a great job, everybody's got their heart in it.

02:03.920 --> 02:07.320
It's one of the best shows that we've got on K-A-M-U-T-V.

02:07.320 --> 02:11.080
Sort of tell people sort of the genesis of this show and how it got started.

02:11.080 --> 02:18.240
It was actually the fall of 2004 and you and I were at a social event together and you

02:18.240 --> 02:22.240
kind of cornered me and what you kind of came up with this idea.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.760
I had this idea because I listened to you on the radio.

02:24.760 --> 02:29.000
And I knew your passion was talking about and respecting our veterans.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.480
And I've had this idea for a long time because I never got called to serve.

02:33.480 --> 02:38.760
I fit in that area after Vietnam and before the next war came along, I never got called.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.560
And I know you had a common experience with that as well.

02:41.560 --> 02:42.920
Your number didn't get picked up.

02:42.920 --> 02:43.920
Right.

02:43.920 --> 02:44.920
In the old lottery.

02:44.920 --> 02:45.920
In the old lottery days.

02:45.920 --> 02:49.680
And I felt this need to do something to respect our veterans because here's people

02:49.680 --> 02:52.080
that have given their time, their lives.

02:52.160 --> 02:57.520
They've done things to serve our country and there are people that have a story to tell.

02:57.520 --> 03:02.240
And I knew that people needed to tell their story and from an occurrence with my father

03:02.240 --> 03:06.920
in law, Ralph Patterson, we call him Pat Patterson, right?

03:06.920 --> 03:09.800
Military man, a Marine, career marine.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.880
And he was telling my son the story of his time in Vietnam.

03:12.880 --> 03:17.080
He did several tours in Vietnam, lost several men under his service.

03:17.080 --> 03:22.040
And when I saw him begin to become emotional about telling his story, I began to understand

03:22.040 --> 03:25.360
that this is something he's never told anyone before.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.480
And there's a need for other men and women to do the same thing.

03:28.480 --> 03:31.880
And I thought, who better to do this job than Tom Turvyville?

03:31.880 --> 03:36.000
So when I saw you at that reception, we thought, I think it took five seconds.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.640
And you said, absolutely count me in.

03:37.640 --> 03:38.640
You bet.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.040
And you and I had a meeting later on and we sort of pounded out the details of it.

03:42.040 --> 03:47.600
And sure enough, like you said, March 1st of 2005 is when we taped the first show with

03:47.600 --> 03:49.080
Dr. Jim Cooper.

03:49.080 --> 03:54.680
So by the way, Dr. Jim Cooper is the only veteran that we've had on twice on the two different

03:54.680 --> 03:56.400
episodes of this show.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.960
I think about two years ago, we had him back again to sort of talk about the beginnings

04:00.960 --> 04:02.480
of the veteran show.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.280
So he's been a big part of this show.

04:04.280 --> 04:08.160
But like you said, John, I did not serve either in the military.

04:08.160 --> 04:12.640
I was during the days of the during Vietnam when they had the first draft lottery.

04:12.640 --> 04:18.480
And I was fortunate, I guess, if that's the word, that my birthday did not come up early.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.440
So I stayed in school and didn't serve.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.480
But I like you had family.

04:22.480 --> 04:27.840
My mother's first husband was a Navy pilot instructor who was killed in World War II, actually.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.840
He was in service.

04:28.840 --> 04:29.840
Exactly.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.640
And my mother remarried.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.840
And that's how I came along from that second marriage.

04:34.840 --> 04:41.640
But again, the passion that I've had has really sort of grown from that, from hearing stories

04:41.640 --> 04:45.520
from my mother and her first husband and his World War II service.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.120
We've had a lot of great, great veterans on this show.

04:50.120 --> 04:54.080
And some of them that we might go ahead and talk about from the outset, we had a show

04:54.080 --> 04:58.600
just a few weeks ago, a Memorial Day special talking about some of the veterans who we've

04:58.600 --> 05:00.280
lost that have been on the show.

05:00.280 --> 05:03.240
And that number is 11 now that are no longer with us.

05:03.240 --> 05:07.160
But we knew of course that that would happen with so many World War II veterans that have

05:07.160 --> 05:08.160
sat in that chair.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.160
That's right.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.680
It's inevitable that it's going to happen indeed.

05:11.680 --> 05:15.400
But we feel honored that we can have the privilege to capture their memory.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.400
I think about my family.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.560
My father, he was boot camp prepared to go to Korea but never had to.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.200
I never knew much about that as I was growing up.

05:24.200 --> 05:28.520
And then through my wife's side of the family, we have someone in every branch of the military

05:28.520 --> 05:30.800
except for the Coast Guard, I think.

05:30.800 --> 05:34.960
I've had my brother's little brother Thunderbirds, you know, very distinguished service, but

05:34.960 --> 05:37.000
they never talk about it much.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.640
To have a man sit here and talk about his story.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.840
And this is something that is near the end of their life before they begin to realize

05:43.840 --> 05:47.320
they might just say that part of their life.

05:47.320 --> 05:50.560
And for you to get that information out of them, it's no small task.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.560
Indeed, because it's there forever and it's very important for their families, especially

05:54.560 --> 05:56.080
those that we've lost.

05:56.080 --> 06:03.520
And certainly there will be those who will go after them too that again have been here

06:03.520 --> 06:06.200
and told their stories.

06:06.200 --> 06:11.680
The oldest veteran that we've had on this show, as a matter of fact, is Sharon Colson's

06:11.680 --> 06:15.280
uncle, Eddie Thompson, who was, I believe, 98 years old.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.280
He was 98 years old.

06:16.280 --> 06:20.880
He passed away just a few days shy of 100 years old.

06:20.880 --> 06:27.720
But he was one of our first veterans and the first one who actually passed away, Speck

06:27.720 --> 06:33.480
Gammann, who was the old sports information director at Texas A&M, who actually, I followed

06:33.480 --> 06:39.160
him in that same position at Texas A&M when I first came to town in 1984.

06:39.160 --> 06:45.080
He was on our show Raymond Schultz, Tom Browning, Rich Thomas, a Korean war veteran who we

06:45.080 --> 06:48.920
lost in 2008.

06:48.920 --> 06:53.720
Jim West was really a tragic story of his death.

06:53.720 --> 06:58.160
Jim was a Vietnam veteran, just that chiseled look Vietnam veteran.

06:58.160 --> 07:03.040
If you were going to do a poster boy of the Vietnam Marine, he was the guy.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.240
He won three purple hearts.

07:05.240 --> 07:10.240
He would only accept two of them because the reason he only accepted two of the purple

07:10.240 --> 07:15.280
hearts, and I never forget him telling me this, was because he didn't want his mother

07:15.280 --> 07:20.560
to get that third knock on the door to tell her that his son had been wounded again in

07:20.560 --> 07:21.760
Vietnam.

07:21.760 --> 07:25.560
She got two knocks on the door to say, our letters.

07:25.560 --> 07:29.800
But didn't want his mother to get that third knock on the door so he refused his third

07:29.800 --> 07:30.800
purple heart.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.320
He wouldn't get the word.

07:33.320 --> 07:37.680
We had Jim on the show, and just a few weeks after we recorded this show, just a very

07:37.680 --> 07:42.840
freakish thing, he was bit by a rattlesnake on his farm and he died from the rattlesnake

07:42.840 --> 07:43.840
bite.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.880
And that was just one of the more shocking deaths of all things.

07:46.880 --> 07:47.880
Go through the war.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.560
To go through the war and a rattlesnake.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.560
And then rattlesnake, right.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.400
He was a former sheriff out in Madison County.

07:53.400 --> 07:57.680
Calvin Boykin Jr. was the first veteran who told us a story that couldn't be told in

07:57.680 --> 07:58.680
30 minutes.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.600
Had to do a two-parter with Calvin Boykin.

08:01.600 --> 08:07.520
And because he was a tank commander in World War II, tremendous story.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.520
Never forget Albert Novak.

08:09.520 --> 08:14.840
A fella who served in the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, all three branches of the

08:14.840 --> 08:16.160
military.

08:16.160 --> 08:20.840
One of Albert's family, one of his nephews called me up one day and said, would you put

08:20.840 --> 08:22.880
my uncle on your show?

08:23.720 --> 08:28.360
He's got pancreatic cancer and he doesn't have long to live.

08:28.360 --> 08:32.360
And he's just a ballifier and I'd love for him to tell the story.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.560
And sure enough, I went over, I talked to Owl, we visited.

08:35.560 --> 08:38.320
I went and picked him up, we came back, we did the show.

08:38.320 --> 08:42.440
We put the show on quickly because we knew that Owl was very sick.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.360
Owl got to see the show, his family got to see the show with him.

08:45.360 --> 08:49.840
And sure enough, just a couple of weeks after that, we did losing.

08:49.840 --> 08:56.480
And Dick Davidson, what a tremendous personality, World War II ground soldier who told us about

08:56.480 --> 09:01.200
something called Operation Keel Hall in World War II that I never know about.

09:01.200 --> 09:07.600
And David West, U.S. Navy veteran from Navisota, who just passed away this last April as a

09:07.600 --> 09:08.760
matter of fact.

09:08.760 --> 09:13.240
And just a few days ago, before we're taping this show, we lost our city councilman Larry

09:13.240 --> 09:17.560
Stewart, who was one of our guests on this show.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.160
He was my neighbor and good friend.

09:21.160 --> 09:25.200
U.S. Navy and of course we all miss Larry who just passed away.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.920
So for those that have passed and those that are still with us, we certainly thank all

09:29.920 --> 09:32.800
of them that have sat in that chair as a matter of fact.

09:32.800 --> 09:37.200
You got to have great respect and admiration for every person that's done that.

09:37.200 --> 09:41.920
Man, woman, who may have they done something that I've never gotten to do.

09:41.920 --> 09:45.680
And I have such admiration for what they've done to protect my freedoms and your freedoms

09:46.680 --> 09:49.800
and give us the ability to be here today to do this kind of a program.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.800
Right.

09:50.800 --> 09:51.800
And everything else we do in our lives.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.800
Right.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.400
I know you spend a lot of time with these people, Tom, when you interview them prepare

09:56.400 --> 09:57.400
for the show.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.400
I do.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.560
And that is really one of the most thrilling things about being able to do this show.

10:02.560 --> 10:07.000
The 28 and a half minutes that we spend here on the set with the cameras and the lights.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
That's a neat thing.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.320
That's just a little piece of what really happens because every one of the veterans who have

10:13.320 --> 10:15.120
appeared on this show.

10:15.120 --> 10:21.900
I've had the opportunity to go to their home a few days before we taped the show and

10:21.900 --> 10:26.200
sit down in their living room or at their kitchen table and sit and talk to them for an hour,

10:26.200 --> 10:30.280
hour and a half, a couple of hours, even as long as three hours with some of them.

10:30.280 --> 10:36.040
And really just hear their story, their whole story about their service and about their

10:36.040 --> 10:40.560
families and how they grew up and how they got into the service and their close calls

10:40.640 --> 10:45.640
and their relationship with their families and their military mates and the people that

10:45.640 --> 10:47.320
they still keep in contact with.

10:47.320 --> 10:52.440
And these are just remarkable stories that I've had the sense to record with a little

10:52.440 --> 10:54.280
digital recorder.

10:54.280 --> 10:58.600
And I've got all of those archived, all of those long form conversations with every one

10:58.600 --> 10:59.920
of our veterans.

10:59.920 --> 11:04.640
And that's been the really neat thing is to be able to go to their homes and talk to them

11:04.720 --> 11:12.600
to sort of get an idea and sort of get to sort of the behind the scenes of what we do.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.880
What I do is I'll go and I'll visit with these veterans and I'll record our whole conversation

11:16.880 --> 11:18.840
and then I will go home.

11:18.840 --> 11:24.080
And on the day that we record the show that morning, I'll relisten to our whole conversation

11:24.080 --> 11:28.040
and I'll take notes and I'll type notes and I'll print them out.

11:28.040 --> 11:31.920
And those are all the papers that you see on the table on the desk all the time.

11:31.920 --> 11:36.840
Those are the notes that I have to sort of lead him in the conversation with the show.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.760
So that's sort of how it works and I get a chance to visit with all of those veterans.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.480
And that's a special time for you too.

11:42.480 --> 11:43.480
Oh yeah.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.360
Because you get something that the rest of us don't get in that up to three hour long

11:47.360 --> 11:48.360
time.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.360
Right.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.360
Right.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.240
Because we have to squeeze that into less than 30 minutes.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.240
In most cases.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.240
That's a tough job.

11:54.240 --> 11:58.360
And in a lot of cases, I know immediately when I'm visiting with them that this is going

11:58.360 --> 12:02.480
to be a double episode or a two part episode, I know immediately that it is because their

12:02.480 --> 12:08.080
stories are so compelling that there's no way that we can do justice to their story in

12:08.080 --> 12:09.080
just one program.

12:09.080 --> 12:15.360
And those are the programs like Dick Davidson or like Calvin Boykin, other stories that we've

12:15.360 --> 12:21.080
run into into two parts because their stories are just worth that much time on the TV.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.520
And there's something I could have done three or four parts.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.440
Like Al Meyer who spent six years as a POW in Vietnam.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.520
People like that.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.520
Things like that.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.520
Experiences.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.880
We never hope we have to have.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.240
But these men have done that.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.760
They've lived through it.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.280
They brought the stories back.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.280
Right.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.440
And somehow you also bring in a little bit of their personal life.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.880
We see a little glimpse of family in addition to the war story.

12:42.880 --> 12:47.720
When we have time at the end, I like to do that when we do because to talk about their

12:47.720 --> 12:51.280
kids and their grandkids and their spouses.

12:51.280 --> 12:55.200
And many of these World War II veterans have been married more than once.

12:56.160 --> 12:59.800
They're why they've been passed away and they've remarried some of them in a lot of

12:59.800 --> 13:00.800
cases.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.800
And these are interesting stories too.

13:02.800 --> 13:08.160
Men or women who have had more than one true love in their life.

13:08.160 --> 13:13.800
And these are fun stories to hear that they have found life again after they may have

13:13.800 --> 13:17.400
lost a spouse after their service in World War II.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.640
Well, they're real people.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.640
Right.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.640
And we see they're like us.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.640
They've got a life.

13:21.640 --> 13:22.640
They've got family.

13:22.640 --> 13:26.760
And it's more than guns and bullets and tanks and planes and things like that.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.080
That's the fun sensational part.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.960
But to go home to a family, that's the hard part.

13:31.960 --> 13:35.960
To go home and have to maybe not talk about your story.

13:35.960 --> 13:36.960
Right.

13:36.960 --> 13:40.160
One guy I need to mention, and there are so many people that we can mention.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.160
In our little 28 and a half minutes that we've got here.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.160
We don't get much time here.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.160
We don't get much time.

13:44.160 --> 13:47.720
But one guy I've got to mention is sort of this whole thing started for me on the radio

13:47.720 --> 13:54.800
in 1999 on WTAW with a show that I do called Bravo Brassist Valley, where every week I

13:54.800 --> 13:56.360
would feature a veteran.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.840
And that's how this all got started.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.560
And what you heard on the radio and that's how we did it.

14:00.560 --> 14:04.840
And that all got started on the back porch of a fellow named Al Hansen.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.200
Al Tex Hansen, they call him Uncle Al.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.520
He still lives here in Bryan.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.800
He's just a delightful gentleman and one of my very closest friends.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.360
I love Al to death.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.680
And one day I was invited to Al's back porch.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.680
That was a special time.

14:16.680 --> 14:17.960
That was a great place to be.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.520
It was Al's back porch.

14:19.520 --> 14:25.400
Because it's there that a lot of his World War II veterans get together on his back porch

14:25.400 --> 14:31.840
and just tell lies and tell the truth and tell all the stories of World War II and their

14:31.840 --> 14:33.240
experiences.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.120
And just sitting there and listening to them all.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.840
And that's where I first met Al Hansen.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.400
That's where I first met Dr. Jim Cooper.

14:39.400 --> 14:43.320
Glenn Morgan, who served on the USS Indianapolis, he was the bugler.

14:43.320 --> 14:47.680
He was the bugler on the USS Indianapolis and spent five nights floating in the Pacific

14:47.680 --> 14:49.680
until they were rescued.

14:49.680 --> 14:54.280
He has Edmund, who worked in the Pentagon for getting some of the names of the people

14:54.280 --> 14:56.440
that I met on Uncle Al's back porch.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.560
But that was a great place to be.

14:58.560 --> 15:05.480
But that's sort of where my passion for Brasis Valley veterans were born on Al's back

15:05.480 --> 15:06.480
porch.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.720
Al, if you're watching, thank you very much.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.560
I love you more, buddy.

15:10.560 --> 15:14.880
And thanks a lot for sort of being there and getting me started on all of this.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.680
That's the time where guys can just be guys.

15:17.680 --> 15:22.120
Whether it's truth or not, the stories are always better the second time around.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.120
And they're mostly true.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.120
And they're mostly true.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.120
That's right.

15:26.120 --> 15:29.120
And you're just lying when they're talking about the girlfriends is what they're doing.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.160
You know, or their wives.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.240
But a lot of great people that I met on there.

15:33.240 --> 15:37.560
We've got some photographs and these photographs are really of no one in particular or no people

15:37.560 --> 15:38.560
in particular.

15:38.560 --> 15:44.200
But just photographs that sort of represent those who I've interviewed.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.760
And these are Old World War II photographs and some even newer.

15:47.760 --> 15:51.560
This is James Wade, who was one of our guests here.

15:51.560 --> 15:54.080
He fought in Europe in World War II.

15:54.080 --> 15:59.560
And the interesting thing with James Wade is that part of his duty was to pull guard duty

15:59.560 --> 16:03.160
over the witnesses of the Nuremberg trials.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.800
And that was just a part of his story that was incredible.

16:05.800 --> 16:11.400
And this is a picture of him in Germany when he was pulling that duty, guarding the witnesses

16:11.400 --> 16:13.320
of the Nuremberg trial.

16:13.320 --> 16:18.720
And he had a story one time of how he had to fight off a crazed German in self-defense

16:18.720 --> 16:19.960
combat.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.680
But that's James Wade from the Brasis Valley.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.760
This is Jim Robbins, grew up in Corpus Christi.

16:24.760 --> 16:27.560
He was a Vietnam helicopter pilot.

16:27.560 --> 16:30.280
He flew Huey's and Loaches.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.680
First Cav.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.760
If you saw the movie, we were soldiers and the helicopter pilots.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.600
Well, that's what Jim Robbins did.

16:36.600 --> 16:42.800
He was a chopper pilot that flew into the Kason Valley and other hotspots of Vietnam.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.360
So you talk about a real Vietnam hero.

16:45.360 --> 16:47.040
That's Jim Robbins.

16:47.040 --> 16:53.560
Yolanda Koslowski, one of the female veterans that we've had on our show.

16:53.560 --> 16:58.760
She was part of the 100th VVAC hospital attached to Patent's Army.

16:58.760 --> 17:07.600
She was one of the first people to treat wounded soldiers in World War II and triage.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.280
Some amazing stories to tell.

17:09.280 --> 17:13.800
And she had to make some difficult decisions of life and death and who could be treated

17:13.800 --> 17:16.640
and who couldn't be treated during World War II.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.240
She's a remarkable lady.

17:18.240 --> 17:23.040
And her husband Ed Koslowski also was one of our veteran guests here on Veterans of

17:23.040 --> 17:24.240
the Valley.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.240
This is H.J.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.240
Marsh.

17:26.240 --> 17:30.640
I've included this picture because what a good looking soldier that guy is.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.640
You talk about him.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.840
You think he had any trouble getting dates when he was young?

17:33.840 --> 17:34.840
I bet.

17:34.840 --> 17:35.840
He probably did pretty good.

17:35.840 --> 17:36.840
He probably did pretty good.

17:36.840 --> 17:37.840
And H.J.

17:37.840 --> 17:41.560
fought both in World War II and in Korea.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.000
End of World War II and the Korean War.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.640
This is Hazel Von Raider who did not serve overseas, but she did serve as a nurse at Fort

17:51.640 --> 17:55.880
Bliss at the Beaumont Hospital there in Fort Bliss.

17:55.880 --> 18:06.000
And then later she flew on airplanes that went out and got wounded soldiers and brought

18:06.000 --> 18:09.320
them back to San Antonio to Fort Sam Houston.

18:09.320 --> 18:18.400
And she used to treat soldiers and nurses who were part of a corrugador and baton and

18:18.400 --> 18:24.040
Japan and in the Manila and the Philippines, quite a lady who lives in Bryan.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.120
And that's Hazel.

18:25.120 --> 18:29.840
This is Dr. Jim Cooper and his younger days are very first veteran on Veterans of the

18:29.840 --> 18:30.840
Valley.

18:30.840 --> 18:31.840
Looks like a Spray Young man.

18:31.840 --> 18:32.840
Dr.

18:32.840 --> 18:33.840
Jim, yeah.

18:33.840 --> 18:39.480
He was a Navy doctor and a personal physician to many of famous admiral and military man

18:39.480 --> 18:42.760
when he was stationed in Washington and on board ship.

18:42.760 --> 18:43.760
Dr.

18:43.760 --> 18:44.760
Jim is very special.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.160
And he's my doctor also.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.760
And still practicing.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.480
Norman Beale from the Brasus County.

18:50.480 --> 18:55.600
He's second battalion, fifth marine to Salt on Korea.

18:55.600 --> 19:01.080
Never forgotten the horror and the cold of the winter when he scaled the beaches at Inshaun.

19:01.080 --> 19:05.560
Norman and his wife Wanda live in the country with a couple of their friendly dogs.

19:05.560 --> 19:09.920
And he was one of our more recent guests on Veterans of the Valley.

19:09.920 --> 19:16.600
Next is Cal Boykin, the late Cal Boykin, 814th Tank Destroyer battalion who was one of

19:16.600 --> 19:18.600
our two part episodes.

19:18.600 --> 19:24.720
His daughter Ann Boykin runs project hold over at the City of College Station.

19:24.720 --> 19:32.800
We lost Cal just about a year ago, but he was a tank commander in World War II and a

19:32.800 --> 19:34.880
very, very interesting fellow.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.360
This next picture is one of my favorite pictures that we've ever put on Veterans of the Valley

19:38.360 --> 19:40.280
because it tells the story.

19:40.280 --> 19:46.080
This is Gary Banta, who is the commander of the American Legion post here in Bryan College

19:46.080 --> 19:49.160
Station, Earl Graham post 159.

19:49.160 --> 19:55.200
He was served in Vietnam and truck convoys delivering supplies to the hot spots.

19:55.200 --> 20:02.760
And John, if a picture ever told a story of a young, lonely, Vietnam soldier a long,

20:02.760 --> 20:07.960
long way from home and wondering what the heck is next coming from me in my life, this

20:07.960 --> 20:09.680
picture tells it.

20:09.680 --> 20:14.880
This tells the story of the lonely brave but somewhat scared soldier in Vietnam.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.560
That is it right there because here's the man by himself and you can see it in his

20:18.560 --> 20:19.560
eyes.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.560
You can't what is going to happen.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.560
Yes, right.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.480
Where am I and when will I be home?

20:23.480 --> 20:25.080
That's Gary Banta.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.880
My Gindry, good buddy of mine.

20:26.880 --> 20:33.000
This is one of our Iraq veterans who served in Iraq in a CB battalion.

20:33.000 --> 20:39.040
They built stuff in Iraq, built stuff for Marine outfits.

20:39.040 --> 20:46.840
So he was a Navy CB and he's still a good friend of mine and he works over at Texas A&M and

20:46.840 --> 20:51.440
has a baby and a baby on the way and a good friend to my.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.160
Ray Ackens is on the right.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.680
Ray Ackens a remarkable story.

20:55.680 --> 21:01.600
He fought in the Pacific's bloodiest battle of World War II, 82 days fighting at Okinawa,

21:01.600 --> 21:03.080
first Marine Division.

21:03.080 --> 21:07.160
He was on the third wave to storm the beach in April of 1945.

21:07.160 --> 21:10.760
And Ray really has three stories and you might be able to tell from that picture.

21:10.760 --> 21:14.440
One of his stories is, in fact let's go to the next picture.

21:14.440 --> 21:19.600
One of his stories is for 36 years he was one of the legendary football coaches in Texas

21:19.600 --> 21:23.920
high school football coaches at Gregory Portland and this picture is taken when they named the

21:23.920 --> 21:29.640
Gregory Portland Wildcatch Stadium after him just about a year ago and the people in the

21:29.640 --> 21:34.280
previous picture and this picture you may recognize the fella on the left because he had

21:34.280 --> 21:37.320
a pretty good year in athletics this last year.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.800
That's Drew Breeze and that's Ray Ackens grandson.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.800
He did a piece.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.800
He did okay.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.800
Super Bowl MVP.

21:42.800 --> 21:43.800
Got a piece through there.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.520
And the fella on the right is Marty Ackens.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.840
That's Drew's uncle who was a quarterback at the University of Texas.

21:49.840 --> 21:54.120
Darryl Royals last all American quarterback as a matter of fact and Ray Ackens not only

21:54.120 --> 21:59.080
had the story of service in Okinawa and World War II but some great stories as a high school

21:59.080 --> 22:02.360
football coach and being Drew Breeze's uncle.

22:02.360 --> 22:03.360
Proud family picture.

22:03.360 --> 22:08.800
He told and he also told the story quite matter faculty about how both the University of

22:08.800 --> 22:12.200
Texas and Texas A&M passed on him in recruiting.

22:12.200 --> 22:17.040
Didn't think he really fit in either program so he went to Purdue and played football instead

22:17.040 --> 22:18.800
and we all know what happened.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.800
You won the Super Bowl and became the MVP.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.520
We don't hit it all the time.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.200
We don't hit him all the time.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.680
This is Al Meyer one of our most compelling stories.

22:26.680 --> 22:33.280
Al spent six years as a POW and Vietnam and this was him returning as from being a POW

22:33.280 --> 22:37.040
returning of the United States getting off the plane and being greeted.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.560
We have some more pictures coming up.

22:38.560 --> 22:46.000
This is a sketch that depicted Al at the Hanoi Hilton as some of the sort of the treatment

22:46.000 --> 22:48.360
that they received at the Hanoi Hilton.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.160
That was a sketch.

22:50.160 --> 22:55.320
Folks welcoming Al Home Al was an Aggie class of 1960.

22:55.320 --> 23:01.560
Is an Aggie class of 1960 and this last picture was him greeting his wife Bobby when he came

23:01.640 --> 23:05.600
home from six years as a POW in Vietnam.

23:05.600 --> 23:09.960
Just recently John of course Kyle Netterville and I got the opportunity to go on the Lone Star

23:09.960 --> 23:18.160
Honor flight with about 100 veterans from the area to Washington DC and some of the pictures

23:18.160 --> 23:19.960
from that that we just had to show.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.680
That was Jim Cooper that you just saw.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.960
That's me at the World War II Memorial.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.960
That coachman is on the left.

23:27.960 --> 23:34.440
Joe Hanover is next to him and then myself and then Frank Litterace, all three who have

23:34.440 --> 23:36.720
been guest on veterans of the Valley.

23:36.720 --> 23:42.440
That was the entire group saluting at Arlington National Cemetery there and just to show

23:42.440 --> 23:44.440
that we really did work.

23:44.440 --> 23:47.720
I mean, taping a promo there in front of the E.O.

23:47.720 --> 23:51.080
GM Memorial there in Washington DC.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.200
That's just some of the photographs.

23:53.200 --> 23:57.680
It's sort of representative of sort of what we've done here on veterans of the Valley.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.400
There's so many other pictures we could have shown.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.400
Yeah, that's the thing.

24:01.400 --> 24:06.480
There's so much to talk about and so much we have to sift through and there's so many

24:06.480 --> 24:09.480
people that have served and that's just here in the Brasas Valley.

24:09.480 --> 24:14.240
We didn't even begin to think about the state, the country, all the hundreds and hundreds

24:14.240 --> 24:16.560
of men that could have been on this program.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.480
You had to choose among these 145 so far.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.760
That's right and there's still a lot more to go.

24:22.080 --> 24:25.040
I don't want people to think that just because we're doing this show here all we're doing

24:25.040 --> 24:28.680
is just recognizing our first five years on the air.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.840
We're not going away.

24:29.840 --> 24:33.880
I want another five years and another five years after that then somebody by the end

24:33.880 --> 24:38.640
will take my place here in this seat and hope that they just keep going and going and

24:38.640 --> 24:43.600
going because we want to get those World War II veterans on obviously because we're losing

24:43.600 --> 24:44.600
them.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.440
What do they say at the rate of a thousand a day?

24:46.440 --> 24:48.160
Yeah, it's the way too fast.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.160
That's the sad part.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.480
We're not going away.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.480
That's the good news.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.720
The sad news is we're not going away.

24:53.720 --> 24:58.560
There's that many more men that have paid this price and have done these wonderful things

24:58.560 --> 24:59.560
for us.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.240
Indeed.

25:01.240 --> 25:04.520
People ask me who are some of the more memorable people that we've had on the show.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.280
Where do you start?

25:06.280 --> 25:14.560
Ed Eyer was a Marine who actually was there on D-Day at Iwojima and who stormed the

25:14.560 --> 25:20.320
beach with the Marines and was there at the taking of Mount Sarah Bachi and when the flag

25:20.320 --> 25:23.600
was lifted at the top of Mount Sarah Bachi he was there.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.680
He didn't witness the flag lifting because he was fighting the war.

25:26.680 --> 25:27.680
He was kind of busy.

25:27.680 --> 25:28.680
He was kind of busy.

25:28.680 --> 25:29.680
Yeah.

25:29.680 --> 25:34.760
General John Miller, Lieutenant General, Commanding General, Fleet Marine, Forest, Atlantic

25:34.760 --> 25:38.040
Commanding General has been on the show.

25:38.040 --> 25:42.360
Ken Lovelace, helicopter chopper pilot.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.360
Pilot there.

25:43.360 --> 25:44.360
And Vietnam.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.640
And all these guys live here right where we live.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.200
That's the interesting part about this.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.200
These guys live here.

25:49.600 --> 25:50.600
They're your neighbors.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.600
They're like us in a book somewhere.

25:51.600 --> 25:52.600
They live here.

25:52.600 --> 25:53.600
They're your neighbors.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.560
They're your people that you're checking out next to in the grocery store.

25:56.560 --> 26:01.680
They're the people that you see in the movies and at the library and they are our neighbors

26:01.680 --> 26:07.040
and a lot of people that you go to church with and a lot of the people, I get a lot of comments

26:07.040 --> 26:11.840
saying, hey, I've lived next door to that guy for 10 years and I never knew that story.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.880
That's why I think we're so relevant though.

26:13.880 --> 26:17.920
And one thing you and I discussed earlier is, and this is sort of an amazing deal too,

26:17.920 --> 26:22.880
because a lot of these people, for whatever reason, will tell their stories to me, a person

26:22.880 --> 26:25.720
that they've just met, pretty much a stranger.

26:25.720 --> 26:29.320
And these are stories that they have not been able to tell to their own families.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.640
Are their own families haven't thought to ask?

26:32.640 --> 26:37.800
And I've had a lot of family members come to me and said, my dad or my granddad said

26:37.800 --> 26:42.560
some things to you that we were able to capture on Veterans of the Valley that we've never

26:42.560 --> 26:43.560
heard before.

26:43.800 --> 26:48.200
And now because of that, because they have the DVD of the show, they'll be able to take

26:48.200 --> 26:55.200
that DVD and hand it down to his kids, grandkids, great grandkids, and it'll be there forever.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.920
And that's something that's so special to us, because they might never have told that

26:58.920 --> 27:00.240
story at all.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.680
They really may not have.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.480
So thanks to you, they've been able to express that.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.480
Indeed.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.120
And again, our 28 and a half minutes is over.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.120
So we've got to go by and go by and go quickly.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.120
It's been a great time.

27:10.120 --> 27:14.840
You know, I would like to consider that these first five years of Veterans of the Valley

27:14.840 --> 27:16.680
are a pretty good start.

27:16.680 --> 27:20.640
But I know that there are lots of stories of service out there still enough to tell.

27:20.640 --> 27:24.560
And we'd like to give a special thanks to the student production assistance.

27:24.560 --> 27:29.600
Not only those working, this program watching, you're watching right now, those many young

27:29.600 --> 27:33.080
men and women who've come and gone over the last five years, they were so hard to help

27:33.080 --> 27:34.080
produce this show.

27:34.080 --> 27:39.480
And my own sincere thanks to Dr. Rob Zant, to John Bennett, Kyle Netterville, Sandra Harris,

27:39.480 --> 27:43.840
and the special thanks to Walter Sanchez and the rest of the staff here at KAMU for making

27:43.840 --> 27:47.040
Veterans of the Valley what we always wanted it to be.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.000
So for John Bennett, I'm Tom Terbivill.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.560
Join us next week.

27:50.560 --> 27:53.080
We'll start the next five years of Veterans of the Valley.
