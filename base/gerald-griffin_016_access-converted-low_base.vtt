00:00.000 --> 00:22.400
The James Clayton Lecture is a special lecture.

00:22.400 --> 00:27.720
There are a series of lectures which are endowed under the will of the late James Clayton

00:27.720 --> 00:38.720
of Turkey, who is an active member of this institution from 1901 to 1944 and to whose

00:38.720 --> 00:45.240
generosity were greatly indebted. The Foundation enables the Institution Council to invite distinguished

00:45.240 --> 00:51.160
engineers or scientists to present a lecture on any subject of importance to the engineering

00:51.160 --> 01:01.480
profession at an opportunity such as this. I have very great pleasure introducing Mr. Gerald

01:01.480 --> 01:09.120
D. Griffin, our lecturer tonight, who took up the post of Director of the NASA Lyndon

01:09.120 --> 01:16.880
B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas just about a year ago. He was born in Athens,

01:16.880 --> 01:24.640
Texas on the Christmas Day, 1934, and received a bachelor's degree in air and optical engineering

01:24.640 --> 01:32.360
from the Texas University Agricultural and Mechanical College, and that was in 1956. He served

01:32.360 --> 01:39.680
four years as an officer in the U.S. Air Force. After the service, he was an air space engineer

01:39.680 --> 01:47.220
with Douglas aircraft, Lockheed Missile and Space Company, and General Dynamics. Mr.

01:47.220 --> 01:54.920
Griffin first joined NASA in 1964, and he joined it at the Johnson Space Center at that time

01:54.920 --> 02:01.320
towards the manned Spacecraft Center, and he was a flight director on all of the 11 Apollo

02:01.320 --> 02:09.640
missions. He was lead flight director on Apollo 12, on Apollo 15, and Apollo 17.

02:09.640 --> 02:20.180
He also involved in all the Gemini flights as a flight controller. During 1976 to 1977, Mr.

02:20.180 --> 02:27.620
Griffin was deputy director of the Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards in California.

02:27.620 --> 02:33.800
Following this post, he was appointed deputy director of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida,

02:33.800 --> 02:41.920
between July 1980 and June 1981. Concurrently, served as associate administrator for external

02:41.920 --> 02:49.760
relations in NASA headquarters at Washington, DC. Mr. Griffin left NASA for a year to become

02:49.760 --> 02:54.640
vice president for systems engineering and management at Scott Science and Technology

02:54.640 --> 03:03.080
Inc. of Lancaster, California. This he did until taking up his current position with NASA

03:03.080 --> 03:11.100
in August 1982. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my greatest pleasure, honor to ask Mr.

03:11.100 --> 03:15.280
Griffin present his lecture tonight.

03:15.280 --> 03:29.120
Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor to be here as I toured the institution

03:29.120 --> 03:35.200
this afternoon. I couldn't help but think what had happened within the confines of this

03:35.200 --> 03:42.320
building in the last 137 years or so. And it's a great privilege to just be able to be

03:42.320 --> 03:50.960
here with you and get the feeling of that community that has been so much to the world in what

03:50.960 --> 03:57.960
has emanated from these confines. I thank you for your kind introduction, Mr. President.

03:57.960 --> 04:02.240
Every time I hear that, I'm quite often wondering if the audience might get the impression

04:02.240 --> 04:09.880
I have trouble holding a job. I've moved around quite a bit and it's been a great deal

04:09.880 --> 04:17.800
of fun. And when I left NASA in 1981, I thought I'd probably never see it again. And I had

04:17.800 --> 04:22.660
been home barely a year when I was asked to come back and be the director of the Johnson

04:22.660 --> 04:29.860
Space Center and I could not stop that call. I had to do it. And it's been an extremely

04:29.860 --> 04:36.500
interesting two years. We are at what I would call a pivotal point in the American Space

04:36.500 --> 04:42.660
Program. Maybe I should say even the free world space program because it truly is an

04:42.660 --> 04:51.020
international flavor now. Granted, we are still in the center of it in the states but the

04:51.020 --> 04:57.740
tentacles are reaching further and further each day. And I am sure that in the next decade,

04:57.740 --> 05:04.620
the free world will join together even more than we ever have before to do some many and

05:04.620 --> 05:11.500
very exciting things in space. I want to talk tonight about the shuttle. Primarily,

05:11.500 --> 05:18.340
it's engineering aspects. I decided that rather than reading my paper verbatim that I wanted

05:18.340 --> 05:25.380
to expand it to some degree and I'll do that, I also will be using some charts that you

05:25.380 --> 05:31.060
haven't, if you have a copy of the paper and I'm in there. But I felt it was important to zero

05:31.060 --> 05:35.380
in on a couple of areas that I thought this audience particularly might like to hear about.

05:36.900 --> 05:43.620
We are in an infant stage with space shuttle. Despite what you hear in the press sometimes,

05:43.620 --> 05:49.460
it's going very well. We have flown all of 12 times and as most of you, I suspect many of you

05:49.460 --> 05:55.860
have been involved in complex programs of one kind or another, that has not given us all the

05:55.860 --> 06:03.460
answers yet that we will need and a number of flights will have to be continued before we have

06:03.460 --> 06:07.780
all of the engineering answers and we'll have some problems yet that we will have to face. But for

06:07.780 --> 06:14.660
a system as large and complex as it is, we are quite happy with the first 12 flights and I think

06:14.660 --> 06:21.460
that in the next year or so, we will close out most of the nagging, let me call it that,

06:21.460 --> 06:30.340
kinds of issues that are still facing us today. I'm going to, the presentation is broken into

06:30.340 --> 06:34.660
several pieces. I'm going to start with an overview of the program because I want to make sure that

06:34.660 --> 06:44.580
we all begin at the same starting point. I use these two slides to try to give you a feel for those

06:44.580 --> 06:51.540
of you that don't have it, the feel for the size of this vehicle. It is very large. The dimensions,

06:51.540 --> 06:58.420
while I won't read them all, the orbiter is roughly the size of the length of a DC-9.

06:59.060 --> 07:04.420
It has an aspect ratio or a thickness ratio, maybe it's a better term, there will more like a 747.

07:04.420 --> 07:09.620
Very, very large vehicle. When I've shown it, an isometric form on the right just to give you a feel

07:10.340 --> 07:16.260
for the major pieces and they are as follows. The airplane device, we call the orbiter,

07:17.220 --> 07:23.940
the it rests at launch on top of a very large external tank and that external tank carries liquid

07:23.940 --> 07:30.980
oxygen and liquid hydrogen and strapped onto the side of each or each side of the external tank are

07:30.980 --> 07:37.140
two very large solid rocket boosters that the largest we have ever flown in our country.

07:38.580 --> 07:46.020
The total weight of this stack at lift-off is approximately 5.5 million pounds. Give or take

07:46.020 --> 07:53.060
a few. We produce about 6.5 million pounds of thrust at lift-off, which is a slightly smaller

07:53.060 --> 08:00.020
number than we had in Apollo. The Saturn V generated about 7.5 million pounds to give you a measure there.

08:00.980 --> 08:10.020
The perhaps the heart of the system, if one wants to think of it that way, is the space shuttle orbiter.

08:10.580 --> 08:17.380
The orbiter is a very complex avionics machine. Many people think of it more like an airplane,

08:17.380 --> 08:23.700
but let me assure you, and you're going to see this later on, it is a mechanical engineer's dream.

08:24.340 --> 08:30.900
There are more actuators, cranks, pulleys, a structure, just enough to keep

08:31.540 --> 08:39.620
any and all of you very, very happy. I want to give you a feel for the profile of how the mission

08:39.620 --> 08:46.180
is flown before we get into some of the details. And then if you'll refer to this slide, it kind of

08:46.180 --> 08:51.780
goes around in a sequence. We end up landing back at a runway and going back into the launch complex.

08:52.740 --> 08:58.580
This is a picture back in this phase right at the very beginning where we are starting to roll the vehicle

08:58.580 --> 09:05.460
to the pad. And in the next shot, you'll see the vehicle on the crawler transporter headed toward

09:05.460 --> 09:12.340
the launch pad. Now this is a very large piece of machinery. The crawler transporter itself weighs

09:12.340 --> 09:18.580
about 6 million pounds. It's the same crawler transporter that we used in Apollo, and we've got two of them.

09:18.900 --> 09:25.460
They were refurbed. In fact, about the only thing we did to them was replace the soft goods

09:26.580 --> 09:34.820
since Apollo, and it was directly usable in this use. The mobile launcher is the rather

09:34.820 --> 09:40.420
square device that the stack is sitting on. It weighs another 8 million pounds. It in itself is

09:40.420 --> 09:47.220
like a little factory. It's got quite a lot of plumbing and servicing for the vehicle in it.

09:48.100 --> 09:51.940
And then the orbiter sitting on top of there in the dry configuration without any propellants,

09:51.940 --> 09:58.980
and it's another 3 and a half million pounds or so. This brings a total then as we're progressing to

09:58.980 --> 10:06.260
the pad of about 18 million pounds on the roll. It moves at about a half a mile an hour to a

10:06.260 --> 10:12.260
mile per hour, and it's a distance of about three and a half miles. So it's a pretty much a major

10:12.260 --> 10:18.180
part of the day to make the track from the vehicle assembly building out to the launch pad.

10:19.700 --> 10:29.220
The next shot will show you that as it's coming up onto the pad, you can see in this area here,

10:29.220 --> 10:36.020
this is the flame trench, and this home over launcher is moved up on top of the flame trench,

10:36.100 --> 10:43.140
and it's set into place on rather large pastels, and then the crawler is removed. It's hydraulically

10:44.260 --> 10:50.820
lowered, and then it backs back down the pad and gets out of the way. So then the engines are

10:50.820 --> 10:58.420
fully exposed to the flame trench. The next shot is a shot of the vehicle. This happens to be STS-1,

10:59.060 --> 11:04.420
made at night. It's a very pretty sight. It's always lit up very brightly if some of you may have

11:04.420 --> 11:11.140
seen some launches, and they usually occur something roughly like the birth of babies,

11:11.140 --> 11:17.380
seems like late at night or early in the morning. And as it's a beautiful sight, very dynamic,

11:17.380 --> 11:24.180
and I hope some of you can someday, if you haven't seen one, see it sitting there. There's a very

11:24.180 --> 11:31.540
inspiring thing before left off just to see that much energy, harnessed sitting there ready to go

11:31.540 --> 11:44.340
is a real sight. Now the launch phase begins with the ignition of the main engines. There are

11:44.340 --> 11:49.860
three main engines in the rear of the orbiter. They produce about a half million pounds of thrust

11:49.860 --> 11:55.940
each, and each solid rocket produces about two and a half million pounds of thrust. So we start

11:55.940 --> 12:00.340
to main engines about eight minutes, sorry, eight seconds prior to lift off, and as soon as they are

12:00.340 --> 12:07.700
up to thrust and measured correctly, then we send the ignition signal to the solid rocket boosters,

12:07.700 --> 12:13.140
and once that happens it's leaving, even if the hold down bolts don't fire, it's gone.

12:16.180 --> 12:20.660
And we've not had a, that's about a triply redundant system to make sure those bolts fire,

12:20.660 --> 12:25.620
but the vehicle sits on the base of the solid rocket boosters, and there's four attached

12:25.620 --> 12:30.660
posts on each. And as you can imagine, we want to make sure it lets go. So as soon as you'd like

12:30.660 --> 12:36.980
the rocket engine, I'm sorry, the solid rocket engine, you have lift off. On the left, the only

12:36.980 --> 12:41.460
reason I'm not going to repeat any of those numbers there but I wanted to show you that was an artist

12:41.460 --> 12:46.740
rendition of what lift off should look like. It's a, you know, there's a date up in the upper right hand

12:46.740 --> 12:52.340
corner of October 79, and because of some delays in the shuttle, we had to get people to trust us

12:52.340 --> 12:57.860
as that's what it would look like. But finally, on the right, you see the lift off of a real one,

12:57.860 --> 13:06.900
and indeed it looked very much like we had planned. The early launch phase is a very dynamic one,

13:07.860 --> 13:18.100
and the, it happens at about 60 seconds after lift off, we pass through a very high Q, a high dynamic

13:18.100 --> 13:22.980
pressure region. That's about the roughest part of the ride, the astronauts report at that point

13:22.980 --> 13:27.620
that there are some vibrations, some noise, a lot of wind noise even that they can still hear.

13:28.500 --> 13:33.860
And at about two minutes after lift off, the solid rockets are expended. All of their propellant

13:33.860 --> 13:40.340
is burned, and they are jettisoned away from the external tank. And at that point, you still have

13:40.340 --> 13:46.180
the three main engines producing about a half million pounds of thrust each, and the orbiter sitting

13:46.260 --> 13:50.180
on top of this external tank that's feeding those engines with liquid oxygen, a good hybrid.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.740
Now on the left, again, was an artist's condition of what that should look like, and on the right,

13:55.300 --> 14:00.660
you actually see the solid rocket blisters starting to, they had been separated. You can see the three

14:00.660 --> 14:06.500
main engines still burning, and you can see the faint haze of the external tank. This was taken

14:06.500 --> 14:12.580
with a ground-based camera at Patrick Air Force Base, and then you can see the solid rockets have

14:12.660 --> 14:18.420
been jettisoned, and they are still burning some residual, what we call tail-off types of propellant,

14:18.420 --> 14:25.060
but they're producing little to no thrust. And at this point, when they go through about 50%

14:25.060 --> 14:29.780
of thrust, we immediately get off of it because it starts to be more of a drag, and it is a help,

14:29.780 --> 14:40.580
and it thrusts the case very quickly. The next shot is a picture of the booster's tumbling

14:40.660 --> 14:47.860
before they are recovered, and in the next shot, you will see the deployment of the drug parachute.

14:49.060 --> 14:56.500
Here's the drug that is starting to stabilize this one rocket. This drug shoot is 54 feet in

14:56.500 --> 15:03.460
diameter, and it pulls out three main shoots for each rocket that are 115 feet in diameter each,

15:04.340 --> 15:09.300
so that these are the largest parachutes that have ever been built for any operational purpose,

15:10.020 --> 15:15.060
and if that isn't enough on the last flight, we were getting a little water damage in this

15:15.060 --> 15:20.500
afternoon, quite a lot of water damage, because even with 115 foot shoots, we were impacting the

15:20.500 --> 15:26.580
water at about 88 feet per second, roughly 60 miles an hour. So we wanted to sew that down some

15:26.580 --> 15:33.380
more in the last flight. On the right-hand booster, we flew three main parachutes of 136 feet

15:33.380 --> 15:42.900
diameter on each, and we got much reduced velocity at impact, a lot less damage, and so for

15:42.900 --> 15:47.620
the subsequent flights from here on, we're going to fly 136 foot parachutes as the main shoots.

15:51.700 --> 15:59.540
These things land about 122 miles or so down range, and float and are recovered. They float in a

15:59.540 --> 16:06.420
vertical mode. We go in with a nozzle in the bottom, make an airtight seal, blow the air,

16:06.420 --> 16:10.900
blow the water out, replace it with air, and they float horizontally at that point, and we

16:10.900 --> 16:18.020
tow them in to Cape Canaveral. Take them apart, send them back to the factory and get a new one.

16:18.020 --> 16:25.140
It comes apart in several segments, and they are loaded at a fire call in the state of Utah,

16:25.780 --> 16:29.940
but the segments are sent by rail, and then they're sent back to us loaded by rail.

16:31.780 --> 16:36.020
As we go on higher during the launch phase, we finally get to the point where we shut the

16:36.020 --> 16:42.180
main engines off. That's just short of orbital velocity. The reason we do that is because we want

16:42.180 --> 16:47.380
this external tank, which is only piece of the system that's not reusable. We want it to re-enter

16:47.380 --> 16:54.100
the atmosphere, and indeed from the Cape, it does re-enter and go into the Indian Ocean.

16:54.660 --> 17:00.260
Mostly in very small pieces, in fact there's very little of it left. It's very lightweight

17:00.260 --> 17:06.660
structure, only weighs 78,000 pounds empty. As you can see, very large 28 feet in diameter,

17:06.660 --> 17:12.420
as I recall, about 150 feet long. We do a small separation maneuver, which the artist's

17:12.420 --> 17:18.020
rendition on the left shows to get away from the tank. In the right hand picture is the actual

17:18.020 --> 17:24.580
picture of an external tank that was taken from an engineering camera located on the base of

17:24.580 --> 17:28.980
the orbital vehicle as it separated. One of the things that you can see is you can see some,

17:29.540 --> 17:35.300
in the actual photograph, you can see some charring of the rear end. That's because it gets

17:35.300 --> 17:43.620
very hot. This whole tank is covered with what we call Sophie spray-on foam insulation used for

17:43.620 --> 17:50.340
two purposes. One is to these are cryogenic fuels, and we must keep them well-encelated as we

17:50.340 --> 17:58.740
can. It also gives protection to the exit heating that we get. At this point, the orbiter is

17:58.740 --> 18:06.340
moving at a speed of about 25,000 feet per second, and a slightly short of orbital velocity.

18:07.220 --> 18:11.940
With the orbital maneuvering system that's on the, and I'll show you a bit of picture

18:11.940 --> 18:19.380
this later, but it's located in the pod of the vehicle back in the back. Two 6,000 pound

18:19.380 --> 18:25.460
thrusters, we top off the last bit of velocity needed to get into orbit, about 200 feet, or

18:25.460 --> 18:30.900
two to 300 feet more per second. At that point, we're in orbit and ready to go into operation.

18:33.700 --> 18:38.260
In the next chart, I'm going to go back to the sequence chart because I'm going to be discussing now

18:38.340 --> 18:46.820
this orbital operations portion of the flight before I get to the entry. This picture on the right

18:46.820 --> 18:54.500
is a picture of STS-41B, and I'll tell you a story of why that's got such a funny number.

18:56.740 --> 19:01.780
As you know, we had an occasion on Apollo 13 one day when we were headed to the moon,

19:01.780 --> 19:07.620
the oxygen tank blew up, and it's so happened that we launched that vehicle at 13-13 hours,

19:08.420 --> 19:13.780
and there are a number of people that says we probably should never have another spaceship

19:13.780 --> 19:18.740
with the number of 13 attached to it. So we tried to devise a system that's got everyone

19:18.740 --> 19:25.940
thoroughly confused, but we don't have an STS-13. The four, when I say 41 Bravo, STS-4,

19:26.580 --> 19:32.420
that's fiscal year 84. One is launched from the east coast and B is the second mission in the year.

19:32.980 --> 19:39.140
Now if I haven't got you all confused, but now something's wrong. This happens to be a shot on orbit

19:39.140 --> 19:45.300
taken from a spaz spacecraft. This was a spacecraft that was inside the payload bay deployed and

19:45.300 --> 19:50.420
looked back at the orbiter. It was eventually recaptured and put back into the payload bay and

19:50.420 --> 19:54.260
brought home. We'll be fine that payload again incidentally. It was built by the Germans.

19:55.220 --> 20:01.620
Very inexpensively and was a super payload. It was three axis stabilized and very performed very well.

20:02.340 --> 20:11.300
You're looking at the two, to give you an idea, this house two satellites that were deployed

20:11.940 --> 20:16.660
before the shot was taken. Those are sun shields that cover them up to protect them thermally.

20:17.460 --> 20:21.220
And in this picture, they've already been deployed, but those were the two that failed

20:22.020 --> 20:27.940
as they were ignited to go on the higher altitude. And I might add parenthetically that we have now been

20:29.060 --> 20:33.380
working for about six months. This happened in February. We've been working for the last five,

20:33.380 --> 20:38.660
six months on techniques to recover those satellites. And the Indonesians that don't want to have

20:38.660 --> 20:42.420
given us to go ahead. And we think Western Union is going to give us the go ahead. And we're going to

20:42.420 --> 20:49.300
fly a mission month after next, November, where we will go retrieve those satellites, put them back into

20:49.780 --> 20:58.100
cargo bay and bring them back to Earth and return them to their owners. This is a place where we got

20:58.100 --> 21:05.540
some relatively bad press because it always was attached to us. NASA, I mean, actually it was a

21:05.540 --> 21:11.380
commercially developed upper stage. NASA did not have anything to do with that development.

21:11.380 --> 21:18.580
The satellite users chose to use them for price and insurance, et cetera. Those of all

21:19.300 --> 21:27.140
been paid off and it is a good stage. On the last mission, we did fly two more of the same upper

21:27.140 --> 21:32.660
stage mission that just landed and they worked just fine. Interestingly enough, we think the problem

21:32.660 --> 21:40.900
there was with the composite nozzles that these devices use. And we have, the community has figured

21:40.900 --> 21:47.380
out a way to scan those nozzles. In fact, they're using a CAT scan process. It looks like the bringing

21:47.380 --> 21:53.140
scan that can detect voids in the composite and think that's what had happened through a process

21:53.140 --> 22:01.540
era. There had been voids in that and so we've corrected that. The, the own orbit operations

22:01.540 --> 22:04.900
involve, can't involve a great deal of other things. Let me show you a picture of the,

22:05.460 --> 22:09.860
this is the deployment of one of those satellites and I can't tell you which one it is. You can see

22:09.860 --> 22:16.180
the Earth to the left. It has been ejected by springs and it is spinning on its way out of the

22:16.180 --> 22:21.860
orbiter bay. I know you don't get to see much of this on TV anymore but on American television,

22:21.860 --> 22:25.460
we replay these things after they happen. They normally happen out of sight of the station

22:26.100 --> 22:31.620
and we have to dump it on videotape and so we get to see these things happen quite out. We saw

22:31.620 --> 22:38.820
all three satellites that were launched on the last vehicle. Other orbit operations involve,

22:38.820 --> 22:46.100
this is what we call the LDF, standing for long duration exposure facility. It's a 20,000

22:46.100 --> 22:56.900
pound structure that we have put many kinds of materials and components, some electronic

22:56.900 --> 23:04.180
components even on the outer skin of it. We deployed it about six months ago. It will stay in orbit

23:04.180 --> 23:11.060
for a year and then we will go retrieve it, bring it back down in order to conduct studies on

23:11.060 --> 23:15.060
what the space environment does to these kind of materials, long duration exposure.

23:15.620 --> 23:22.500
Obviously if we want our systems to last longer, we will have to make sure that we provide the

23:22.500 --> 23:26.740
right kind of coatings, right kind of protection and we want to know more about the long term effects

23:26.740 --> 23:34.820
of the space environment. This was incidentally built all in-house at NASA. There are some structures,

23:34.820 --> 23:42.820
engineers at Langley Center had a real good time at this. That's the remote manipulator arm that

23:42.820 --> 23:48.580
you see poking out the top. It's actually holding onto it at deployment and then it just let it go.

23:48.580 --> 23:54.740
And it's stabilized by gravity gradient and it's with this long axis pointing it to your.

23:56.180 --> 24:02.580
Another kind of operation we do is our manned operations. A number of EVAs are scheduled

24:03.540 --> 24:08.580
extra vehicular activities are scheduled in the near future. This is a picture of Bruce McCannellus

24:08.660 --> 24:13.380
on the checkout of the man maneuvering unit. It was the first time we had put a man outside

24:13.940 --> 24:21.140
and cutting loose without any tethers. It worked very well and we are in the process now we've

24:21.140 --> 24:25.940
flown another mission since then that's when we repaired the solar max mission. We did have some

24:25.940 --> 24:32.180
problem with recovery device so as a result we finally captured the solar max satellite that we

24:32.180 --> 24:36.900
repaired with the remote manipulator arm with the maneuvering unit work fine. We are going to

24:37.220 --> 24:45.540
on the retrieval mission that I mentioned earlier we will be using the MMU to retrieve the two

24:45.540 --> 24:51.940
satellites that have failed to get into the proper orbit. And the astronaut will have a device

24:51.940 --> 24:57.940
on the front of him we call a stinger which will actually he'll fly out and poke it into the nozzle

24:58.580 --> 25:06.580
of the spent stage on the upper stage and then it has a we call it a molly boat or a lag boat

25:06.660 --> 25:11.060
kind of device that pulls out and then he tightens it down and he drags it back to the shuttle.

25:11.860 --> 25:16.340
At that point he puts a grapple fixture on it, remote arm reaches in and gets it puts it back into

25:16.340 --> 25:20.180
the payload bay. That's what it says here and that's what we're going to try to do.

25:24.340 --> 25:29.780
Fellow that is going to do that is a good friend of some other people here in the hall tonight.

25:30.580 --> 25:34.500
His name is Joe Allen he is a scientist he's also one of the best

25:35.300 --> 25:38.820
EVA specialists that we have so Joe got that assignment he's happy to do it.

25:43.380 --> 25:46.100
All right now I'm coming down the right hand side of the left chart.

25:48.020 --> 25:53.060
As we start to end the mission then what we do is we slow the vehicle down by about 300 feet per second

25:54.660 --> 25:58.980
and that's enough to knock it out of orbit. We do that with those same engines that we toughed off

25:58.980 --> 26:03.700
the orbital velocity with we just turn the vehicle around and fire it backwards.

26:06.660 --> 26:11.940
We do that about 4,400 nautical miles from the landing site. At that time we're back to about

26:11.940 --> 26:16.820
25,000 feet per second and in the early stages of entry as you see depicted by this picture

26:18.820 --> 26:21.700
the angle of attack is like 40 degrees so it's very high.

26:24.500 --> 26:28.020
Here is a picture taken again from a ground-based camera during entry.

26:28.980 --> 26:35.540
This is an altitude of only about 100,000 feet and at this point the vehicle is slowed down it is

26:35.540 --> 26:42.980
a glider that has no power obviously so it's a one-shot landing and it better be right the first time.

26:44.340 --> 26:54.820
The touchdown speed varies from about 180 to 230 knots. There is a very steep descent.

26:55.380 --> 27:01.460
It's a 24 degree glide slope. A standard aircraft is roughly on the order of a degree and a half

27:01.460 --> 27:07.700
two degrees. This is very steep. There's a pre-flare maneuver at about 2500 feet and then he slows

27:07.700 --> 27:14.420
down across the boundary and puts it on the ground. That is worked very well and what I want to do now

27:14.420 --> 27:19.540
is show you a little bit about how the structure is put together in the vehicle. Here's a touchdown

27:19.620 --> 27:27.940
on the lake bed. We go to the lake bed on occasions when we did for all of the landing tests that we

27:27.940 --> 27:32.500
did early in the program because there's a lot of room for error and it turns out we didn't need

27:32.500 --> 27:37.940
much on the way and it all worked well. We also go to the lake bed for the first flight of any new

27:37.940 --> 27:43.380
orbiter and that's one reason that's why we landed discovery on this last flight. We landed back at

27:43.380 --> 27:50.020
the lake bed because it was the first time we had flown that vehicle. I should say we've got

27:50.020 --> 27:57.460
three vehicles delivered now. Challenger, Columbia, and Discovery and we are awaiting the delivery

27:57.460 --> 28:03.220
in about March of next year of Atlantis which will give us four orbiters and then there is a

28:06.260 --> 28:10.740
I guess I could call it a controversy at least a discussion on the possibility of building a fifth

28:10.740 --> 28:22.420
orbiter but at about 1.7 billion per coffee in dollars that's it's a decision that is not going

28:22.420 --> 28:28.660
to be easy for to get it and frankly I don't know whether we will or not. The four vehicle fleet

28:29.300 --> 28:35.300
will support the flight rate that we have planned but there are some people that feel like a fifth

28:35.380 --> 28:41.380
would give us some insurance and that's kind of what it falls on. On the structural side of this

28:41.380 --> 28:48.980
vehicle now I go right onto the next slide. I wanted to point out one thing this vehicle is the

28:48.980 --> 28:55.780
orbiter is literally built all over the United States and comes together at Palmdale, California to be

28:55.780 --> 29:02.340
assembled. The wing for instance is built by Grumman. The mid-fusilized area that you see this whole

29:03.060 --> 29:08.100
I mean you're right my pointer here. You see that. This whole area here is built by General Dynamics.

29:09.860 --> 29:17.140
The payload bay doors are built by Rockwell, the crew cabin and the far-ducing lies are all

29:17.140 --> 29:21.860
Rockwell with tails built by Fairchild. The homespods are built on McDonald's Douglas.

29:23.940 --> 29:28.180
Literally all over the states we've got people building basic structure of this vehicle.

29:28.340 --> 29:34.340
The words on that left hand chart pretty well explained the kind of technology that we use to build

29:34.340 --> 29:41.140
the structure. It's pretty much basic airplane structure. We decided to do that and then cover it

29:41.140 --> 29:48.180
with thermal protection. Aluminum will take generally in the area of 350 degrees temperature without

29:48.180 --> 29:52.820
permanent deformation. So we had to design a thermal protection system that I'll talk about a

29:53.540 --> 29:59.780
little bit later than insured its temperature at the aluminum would not exceed that 350 degrees.

29:59.780 --> 30:08.180
And that's worked very well. On the right you see an exploded view and a visible looking inside

30:08.180 --> 30:13.700
the structure. I put that there for reference to show you that it is basically a rib and stringer

30:14.420 --> 30:22.740
type device. Now let's look at each major piece. Here's the forward fuselage

30:23.140 --> 30:30.900
crew module. The crew module which is just this pressurized area here had to be built and isolated

30:30.900 --> 30:36.580
from thermal deathbed formations because it is a pressure holding device. So it is fully welded

30:36.580 --> 30:42.900
interglume machine panels that are that are completely welding. No bolts or anything holding it

30:42.900 --> 30:48.500
together. The rest of the structure however and then that I should say too that that cabin

30:49.060 --> 30:56.900
free floats inside the upper and lower forward fuselage has. In that it is isolated.

30:57.940 --> 31:03.220
Its loads are taken out through the vertical and side longitudinal loads for instance.

31:03.220 --> 31:08.740
There's two there's a fitting here and a fitting on the far side that looks something like

31:08.740 --> 31:16.260
trunion devices that take loads in two directions. There's a pin here that will only take load in one

31:16.260 --> 31:24.500
direction and it's allowed to rotate in any other that takes out the vertical. That associated

31:24.500 --> 31:29.860
with the two trunions take out the vertical loads and then there's a lateral load fitting down here

31:29.860 --> 31:37.540
in this area on each side that only takes out the lateral loads. So the crew module is inside this

31:38.420 --> 31:43.620
outer shell if you will and isolated from the thermal death formations that are on the outside

31:44.420 --> 31:53.780
skin. That was a real problem in the initial design because these wells are long they're big

31:53.780 --> 32:00.340
and they were subject to a lot of manufacturing error early on and they we felt like they had to

32:00.340 --> 32:06.740
be essentially perfect and indeed that's they've turned out to work very well. We've learned a lot

32:06.740 --> 32:12.100
about it and in the crew module that we built for the Atlantis vehicle which will be delivered next

32:12.100 --> 32:19.780
year the learning curve in those four builds was extreme took them much less time the first one

32:20.900 --> 32:27.220
was tough and they had to redo many wells and they had a lot of engineering had a mostly associated

32:27.220 --> 32:32.980
with manufacturing techniques just to make these rather long wells. That's come along very nicely

32:33.780 --> 32:41.300
however in the last build. The F structure is very interesting and that's this this

32:42.100 --> 32:48.420
oriental again here that's this area right here this has to of course the main engines fit into

32:48.420 --> 32:53.540
there so there's a tremendous load placed on that structure. Now I've got two views of that this

32:53.540 --> 32:59.380
one on the right is the more or less the outer skin view if you will and there's nothing too dynamic

32:59.380 --> 33:07.700
here machined bulkheads and and interglomy machined skin in some cases but for the most part nothing

33:07.700 --> 33:13.620
too exotic. It's when you turn around look at it from the other side and this is at the rear of

33:13.620 --> 33:20.420
that F structure and those members are where they react all the loads for the main engine has

33:20.420 --> 33:26.660
got to dump those loads into the rest of the orbiter structure to build and that's large it's hard

33:26.660 --> 33:34.420
to tell here but it is extremely large piece of structure and we went to a diffusion bonding technique

33:34.500 --> 33:40.500
titanium in this case and if you're familiar with diffusion bonding you put it in strips and put it

33:40.500 --> 33:47.940
under pressure and heat until it flew the way I think of it as it flows smoothly and makes a a solid

33:47.940 --> 33:57.620
homogeneous beam or our structural member. The the fact was is that in those days we could just not

33:57.620 --> 34:02.740
get forging as large as we needed and that's why they went to diffusion bonding which is a very

34:02.740 --> 34:09.700
expensive and in slow process if we build a fifth orbiter and in the fourth orbiter that's already

34:09.700 --> 34:15.700
built those both in the 10 years it's taken us to develop shuttle we now have forging that we're

34:15.700 --> 34:21.540
fitted so we've actually changed on 104 or I'm sorry Atlantis and 104 is a vehicle number we've

34:21.540 --> 34:28.980
changed to to a forging for this F structure. The other thing we did is that we found out we could

34:29.460 --> 34:35.780
I want to point out these boron epoxy tubular struts that's a bit of a myth in this

34:35.780 --> 34:43.140
gnomer what we did we could save some weight by bonding boron epoxy composite on the outside of

34:43.140 --> 34:51.300
the titanium structure and we saved as I recall the number about 20% in our weight by strengthening

34:51.460 --> 34:59.620
the titanium with a bonded graphite or boron epoxy over the top of that's worked very well

35:00.980 --> 35:06.100
and we think that in it's one of the things that we really think in future structural work that

35:06.100 --> 35:12.100
we'll see more and more of them getting the metal out and using epoxy or I'm sorry composite

35:13.220 --> 35:19.140
materials to to give you added strength. The F structure as you can imagine is a very

35:19.940 --> 35:26.740
critical item we inspect this very carefully after each flight for cracks etc it's held up

35:26.740 --> 35:32.820
extremely well and done well. Talk about some of the other mechanical systems I'm not going to go

35:32.820 --> 35:39.220
into all the structure I want to talk about some of the other mechanical systems and this is where

35:39.220 --> 35:48.420
I say earlier a mechanical engineer is delight we've got a lot of moving parts on this vehicle the

35:49.780 --> 35:58.660
doors vents remote manipulators and landing gear etc and I want to talk about a couple of them

35:59.540 --> 36:06.980
the talk about the main and the nose gears this is an interesting design it's very simple

36:08.100 --> 36:13.540
it things get very simple when you only have one opportunity to land and you can't

36:14.020 --> 36:19.460
there's no reason to have a retraction system because there's no ability to go around and so

36:20.420 --> 36:26.660
we were able to design this system very simply very reliably it's really a gravity fall as all it is

36:26.660 --> 36:31.620
you just hydraulically unlock the latches and there's some stored energy hydraulic

36:32.340 --> 36:38.100
pistons that help shove the thing down and they all they all fold forward so that the air load also

36:38.100 --> 36:45.780
helps to as you're moving helps to to drop them have worked very very well the one test that we

36:45.780 --> 36:52.180
have yet to do we've used for steering only differential braking to date and we're going to

36:53.860 --> 36:59.860
in the next flight or two engage nose wheel steering the reason we have and as we we have had

36:59.860 --> 37:06.580
some problems in the in the control laws that this is a very heavy machine and a very small gear

37:07.300 --> 37:12.740
and some of you that have dealt with airplanes on the same line we haven't needed nose wheels during

37:12.740 --> 37:16.900
they could engage you anytime they need it but they haven't needed it they felt comfortable using

37:16.900 --> 37:22.180
differential braking but this this system has worked extremely well and it's very simple very

37:22.180 --> 37:32.260
reliable the the other system that I want another system I want to talk about is not many people

37:32.260 --> 37:38.500
understand how important what I'm about to say is the if I can make this error work and we can see it

37:39.380 --> 37:45.380
right here on the bottom of the orbiter is the only way we can get the liquid oxygen and liquid

37:45.380 --> 37:51.300
hydrogen into the main engines we do that through these two doors we call it the ET closeout doors

37:52.100 --> 37:58.020
and then those doors must close because that's one of the hotter areas of the vehicle on entry

37:58.820 --> 38:04.580
so I can't in a line drawing explain to you exactly how the doors work but I can tell you they are

38:04.580 --> 38:13.060
folded back from their closed position 180 degrees actually they're folded this way toward each other

38:13.060 --> 38:19.300
there there's a device that that latches the two of them together because this has to go through

38:19.300 --> 38:25.060
acid through this high dynamic dynamic pressure region and all without fluttering and coming apart

38:25.620 --> 38:32.020
and then after the tank is saw is separated the doors are actuated closed all the way around and then

38:32.740 --> 38:38.820
firmly hogged in and pulled in with latches to give a very tight seal so that you don't leak hot

38:38.820 --> 38:48.100
gases in there during the entry it's something we can't see it must work the the crew actuates

38:48.100 --> 38:54.180
these doors closed and they get some talkbacks that tell them that they're closed in the cockpit but

38:54.180 --> 39:02.660
it's strictly trust that they indeed did close and close firmly so we've they spent a lot of

39:02.660 --> 39:08.660
time these are brillium doors because they did not want them to deform and then they've got tile

39:08.660 --> 39:16.420
actually glued onto them bonded to them that give you the thermal protection very very important

39:16.420 --> 39:21.380
device and it's a little bit that could be for one of the nail if it didn't work right

39:22.340 --> 39:29.540
she was lost in therefore the battle but i'm happy to report we've had no problems with that

39:31.300 --> 39:38.020
the payload bay doors are very large they're 60 feet long they are made of graphite epoxy

39:38.820 --> 39:43.860
and they are covered since this is a cool area of the vehicle they're covered with a no-mex blanket

39:43.940 --> 39:52.420
on top just uh it looks well it looks like a blanket of no-mex there are four 15-foot panels on each side

39:52.420 --> 39:59.700
and on the back side of the doors are the radiators that we we pump free on 21 through and pump it

39:59.700 --> 40:04.580
through the cold plates where the avionics are and take out the the heat that's generated inside the

40:04.580 --> 40:10.660
orbiter two of the radiator panels on each side can also be deployed and you see that in the left

40:10.660 --> 40:14.980
hand you can also see it in the right hand version they can be differentially deployed from the

40:14.980 --> 40:21.300
doors and that gives you radiation out both sides both surfaces and we have done that in orbit however

40:21.300 --> 40:25.780
most of the heat loads that we have worked with we've been able to leave the two forward panels on

40:25.780 --> 40:30.820
each side undeploied and when we don't have to have it we prefer not to because it's just one less

40:30.820 --> 40:38.500
thing that could go wrong if you had to re-enter rather fast and you didn't have time to do an EVA

40:38.500 --> 40:43.380
go out and cut the links there are contingency ways to get doors closed and all by going EVA

40:43.380 --> 40:49.540
but you need a little time uh these devices have worked very well the other the area that we had

40:49.540 --> 40:54.820
you're going to hear me say a little bit about it these latches around the air bulkhead here

40:55.380 --> 41:00.580
there's some forward latches and the latches now in the center line were a real uh

41:00.580 --> 41:06.100
kinematic problem of saw they worked well we've had one problem and I'll mention that in a

41:06.100 --> 41:13.540
in just a minute I'll spend a few charts on the thermal protection system which is a subject

41:13.540 --> 41:19.460
in itself for this vehicle maybe I should have said for to some of you that may not know this

41:19.460 --> 41:24.660
vehicle is fully reusable and it's the first spaceship that we've ever built for that purpose

41:25.220 --> 41:28.980
in fact it's first space ship that's ever been built anywhere for that purpose the

41:29.620 --> 41:39.140
some interesting figures the mercury program, Germany, Apollo all used a blade even material

41:39.140 --> 41:45.220
because it was a one-time use and it heated and sloughed off and that was it when we started

41:45.220 --> 41:51.140
talking about the shuttle we had to do something that could be reusable without this giant turnaround

41:51.220 --> 42:00.980
problem of trying to replace a bladers the decision was made to use a rigidized silica fiber

42:00.980 --> 42:08.020
its glass you hold one of these tiles which is typically six inches or so square anywhere from two

42:08.020 --> 42:12.420
to three inches in thickness and it feels like a piece of star foam it's very very light

42:14.100 --> 42:20.100
and if you look at the next chart which is not a very good picture I wanted to try to get something

42:20.340 --> 42:26.340
show you what the cross section looked like the rigidized fiber that's shown here this is a

42:26.340 --> 42:39.060
microscopic view and and the rigidized fiber is a 99.6 percent pure silica and it's in a cut fiber

42:39.060 --> 42:47.300
link that's mixed with liquid silica which we call ludox to make a slurry it is then pressed

42:48.020 --> 42:52.420
into the right volume to get the density we want which is about nine pounds per cubic foot

42:53.460 --> 42:58.580
and it's then baked at 2400 degrees for some length of time and it forms a very hard brick

42:59.140 --> 43:04.580
of this very light material it's then machined with a mission of a milling machine

43:05.220 --> 43:11.700
computerized to very tight tolerances because it must match a smoozer must make a smooth

43:11.700 --> 43:18.180
service on the outside of the vehicle the the coating that we put over that because this is

43:18.180 --> 43:24.580
very soft you can poke your finger into it is a liquid glass coating borosilicate by name which

43:24.580 --> 43:28.660
doesn't mean much to me I don't know what it means much to you or not but it's borosilicate

43:28.660 --> 43:35.380
and it is a liquid glass that makes it gives the tile a very hard surface you can poke through it

43:35.380 --> 43:40.980
with a sharp fingernail or a screwdriver but it is it gives it a hard surface

43:42.180 --> 43:47.940
uh and then these are bonded to the I'm not sure you have that sign it's bonded to the aluminum

43:47.940 --> 43:56.340
uh directly the uh the tile is been in later vehicles replaced by quite a lot of what we call

43:56.340 --> 44:03.940
advanced flexible reusable surface insulation after isy and that is a more of a blanket material

44:03.940 --> 44:10.020
we could do that because in the earlier flights we had a lot of data taken on temperatures and as

44:10.020 --> 44:16.980
most uh thermal engineers like most mechanical uh engineers there was some conservative estimates

44:16.980 --> 44:22.020
made and we found some areas of the vehicle not as hot as we had expected so we were able to go

44:22.020 --> 44:28.340
to this more clock like insulation but we were only able to catch uh discovery which we've just

44:28.340 --> 44:35.140
flown N104 so what we've and Atlantis come so what we've got now is we've got a fleet of vehicles

44:35.140 --> 44:40.900
that have different uh they look pretty much to the eyeball constant but there's actually quite a

44:40.900 --> 44:48.500
lot of difference in the outside protection of thermal purposes the uh I know you can't read the

44:48.500 --> 44:54.660
chart on the the left you can't read the fine numbers but that's a it's a picture of the upper

44:54.660 --> 45:00.980
part of it is the lower surface view uh in on the top of that vehicle and the the bottom half of

45:01.540 --> 45:08.260
that plan form is the upper surface view and those are isotherms that uh for the worst case design

45:08.260 --> 45:13.780
mission that we can think of and let me just summarize by saying the lower lower forward fuselage

45:13.780 --> 45:20.740
right up in the chin area is the hottest that peaks up around 2300 degrees uh the lower wing is

45:20.740 --> 45:26.500
about 2,000 the lower body flaps that around that same 2400 you'll see some higher figures on this

45:26.500 --> 45:32.740
chart but again that's this extreme design mission that we that we've designed our system to I

45:32.740 --> 45:38.900
don't think we'll ever see it um there are hotter temperatures and if you look on the next chart

45:40.580 --> 45:45.700
the reinforced carbon carbon is used on the very tip of the nose on the leading edge of the wing

45:46.500 --> 45:53.540
primarily and those areas are greater than 2300 degrees and there we had to go to this

45:53.540 --> 45:58.900
reinforced carbon carbon it's a laminated structure it's coated with silicon carbide

45:59.940 --> 46:08.580
to keep it from oxidizing and we are slowly trying to let me say lighten those panels by

46:08.580 --> 46:13.780
several techniques and I think in in the future we will be able to go back and retrofit

46:13.780 --> 46:19.380
those leading edge panels in the nose with lighter material that composite high-spring

46:20.100 --> 46:25.940
um technology is growing by leaps and bounds as most of you are probably aware and there are

46:25.940 --> 46:30.100
some materials now that are beginning to look very promising but the reinforced carbon carbon

46:30.100 --> 46:35.620
has worked very very well on the bottom of the vehicle look at the top half of the right hand

46:35.620 --> 46:42.980
picture there where it says lower surface is most all black tile the black tile is got the coating

46:42.980 --> 46:47.700
it's a glass coating as I mentioned earlier but it takes the higher temperatures it'll take

46:47.700 --> 46:56.260
the between 1200 and and about 2300 degrees temperature the crosshatch area on the if you look

46:56.260 --> 47:03.460
at the bottom half of the top chart on the right or the top platform is mostly white tile and

47:03.460 --> 47:10.580
that tile has a different coating which is a little lighter and it's good from about 700 to 1200

47:10.580 --> 47:16.820
degrees and that's in the area that's the area where we have replaced a lot of that material on 103

47:16.820 --> 47:21.940
I'm sorry I used the vehicle numbers on discovery and in lannis we have replaced a lot of that

47:21.940 --> 47:29.220
white tile with this flexible claw and then we've got a few places where we had to use metallic

47:29.220 --> 47:37.300
closeouts because we just couldn't do it any other way now next chart the tile is laid up like

47:37.300 --> 47:42.100
this the one on the right incidentally the shot on the right here is the bottom of the vehicle as

47:42.180 --> 47:47.940
is being hoisted in the vertical assembly building and I showed it just to I threw it in here it's a

47:47.940 --> 47:52.660
little dark but to show you that that's all black tile that's all the high insulation tile and you

47:52.660 --> 47:59.620
can see although you can't see the detail that's this area where the external tank doors that have

47:59.620 --> 48:04.580
to get closed properly are on the open here because we're getting ready to make it to the external

48:04.580 --> 48:11.460
tank on the left you will see the the tile the way it's put together it's these are about six

48:11.460 --> 48:18.580
inch blocks the reason the these things have no essentially flexibility to them but the skin

48:18.580 --> 48:27.700
had to give so they're put together with a certain gap in a certain step in there step tolerance

48:27.700 --> 48:33.860
between one tile to the next very tight and we did that so that the tile could could move if you

48:33.860 --> 48:38.900
will and we had to put the gap in because if we didn't they were buddy that together as they bent

48:38.900 --> 48:47.860
they would break on each other so we the gap was varies from about 45,000ths of an inch to about

48:48.580 --> 48:56.420
20,000ths of an inch the step tolerance depends on which view you decide the vehicle you're on

48:56.420 --> 49:01.220
before it says step here on the on the upper portion of this right in here if you see that

49:02.500 --> 49:08.020
varies those tolerances vary from about 17,000 to 50,000ths and again depending on the heat

49:09.380 --> 49:20.020
influx there it's bonded let me the aluminum is first painted with RTV standard pretty much

49:20.020 --> 49:26.820
standard RTV adhesive there's then a strain isolation pad and that's a no-max pad

49:27.700 --> 49:34.180
it's roughly 10th of an inch thicker so and that's in order to let the vehicle flex again without

49:34.180 --> 49:42.100
breaking the bond that's put on next and then RTV is painted on top of that and the tile is bonded

49:42.100 --> 49:49.940
onto to the to the RTV there so you have you have aluminum you have RTV you have a strain isolation

49:49.940 --> 49:56.980
pad RTV and then the tile we bond these things and then we do pull test on them and we actually

49:56.980 --> 50:03.700
listen with a highly sensitive sonic device to see if we can hear any breaking and there's a certain

50:03.700 --> 50:10.660
number of and I don't know the number but it's a certain number of clicks per second that is acceptable

50:11.700 --> 50:18.900
frankly it makes me nervous to have any clicks but but there is an acceptable standard that as you

50:18.900 --> 50:25.060
start to pull on it and they listen with a sonic device after it's cured it has to pass an inspection

50:25.780 --> 50:31.700
we have had super luck after we got past the first vehicle with this technique the first technique

50:31.700 --> 50:37.700
or the the first vehicle was very much of a learning experience many many errors made and as a matter

50:37.700 --> 50:45.060
of fact Columbia had essentially all of its tiles 32,000 of them put on it one time they all came off

50:45.060 --> 50:50.580
and and not at once but we kept finding problems and we took them all off and put them back on again

50:50.580 --> 50:55.700
and that's one reason the shuttle was it's probably the primary reason the shuttle was 18 months to two

50:55.700 --> 51:01.620
years late getting off the ground because of the tile problem the other vehicles have gone very very

51:01.620 --> 51:12.580
easily and I think this is one that's behind us the I might just mention discovery in Atlantis the

51:12.580 --> 51:23.460
last two orbiters have only 21,000 tile on them the 102 or Columbia and Challenger had over 30,000

51:24.420 --> 51:30.820
so we've made quite an improvement in getting away from the the detail the replacement of these tiles

51:31.540 --> 51:36.020
okay let's look at some typical problems that we've had and this is certainly not all of them

51:36.580 --> 51:44.740
and I do this with little trepidation my friends in the American press tend to hang around in this area a

51:44.740 --> 51:52.020
lot and many of the things that that I'm going to show you here have been relatively minor some not

51:52.020 --> 51:58.100
some minor and but all in all I think we've learned a great deal from solving these things

51:59.060 --> 52:03.060
one that you wouldn't think of and this I'll have to orient you a little bit you're looking at

52:03.060 --> 52:09.140
the launch pad and you'll remember that I told you that as we put this mobile launcher down

52:09.780 --> 52:14.100
this is these are the flame trenches this is where the solid rocket loosters exhausts our gases

52:14.100 --> 52:20.420
down into the flame trench and on STS-1 when we flew it the first time we got a tremendous

52:20.420 --> 52:27.220
resurgence of energy from when the SRB is ignited to the point that it completely it popped and

52:27.220 --> 52:33.220
buckled the F-teach shield around the main engines the engines bells were all knocked around and so

52:33.220 --> 52:40.500
forth and it was we had had to extrapolate from a one six scale model and we missed it by a lot

52:41.380 --> 52:48.500
so what we did and it was obvious the pictures of the lift off of STS-1 the detail engineering

52:48.500 --> 52:54.740
pictures in this area were frightening because you could see the engine bells deform and you

52:54.740 --> 53:01.220
could see the F-teach shield pop a couple of times so a very simple solution this was laid

53:01.220 --> 53:07.060
this in focus at Johnson and at the Kennedy Space Center this is a close-up you can see it not too

53:07.060 --> 53:13.620
well here this is before we put this device in but here these are water troughs and let me go to

53:13.620 --> 53:19.780
the next slide and I'll show you this is parachute type material and that's water you see in

53:19.780 --> 53:26.820
there about a foot deep that we just laid across the hole and the purpose is is that when the SRB

53:26.820 --> 53:32.100
is ignited you absorb that energy with this water it just blows this stuff completely away it's gone

53:33.540 --> 53:39.780
almost vaporizes it but it was a very simple fix we wrestled with all kinds of ways to to absorb

53:39.780 --> 53:44.580
that energy so that it would not go all the way down to the bottom of the flame trench and rebound

53:44.580 --> 53:54.260
into the orbiter and as it turns out this is worked very nicely I was strictly skeptical of this

53:54.260 --> 53:58.100
I didn't think it would work at all but the engineers kept running the figures and they said yeah

53:58.100 --> 54:03.140
yeah it works so sure enough we tried it and it has now we've got some very exotic ways to fix it

54:03.140 --> 54:08.260
later with water sprays and all that sort of thing but this thing works so well and it's so

54:08.260 --> 54:11.780
inexpensive I suspect we'll be stuck with this for a long time it's very reliable

54:13.700 --> 54:18.580
but again it's a it's a problem that you wouldn't even think about and there's no way as most of you

54:18.580 --> 54:23.700
have that have been involved in trying to scale large things when you try to scale them down or

54:23.700 --> 54:28.340
when you take something small about scale it out scaling errors can really get to you and that's

54:28.340 --> 54:36.980
what that's what really happened here okay here was a problem we had on STS 3 and STS 4

54:37.940 --> 54:42.580
3rd and 4th fire the shuttle we tried to close the payload bay doors and

54:43.300 --> 54:47.540
lo and behold the first time they tried it there was an interference and it didn't work

54:49.380 --> 54:56.020
and as a matter of fact the latches on that afbal kid which is this area right in here would not

54:56.020 --> 55:01.300
make up they would not the door was not down far enough to make up the fellows looked at it

55:01.380 --> 55:08.900
Thailand said now what have we done to this vehicle well we had some some reasons to be in a tail

55:08.900 --> 55:14.500
sun attitude tail looking at the sun for a long long period and then we also had a reason to be

55:14.500 --> 55:21.540
no sun attitude and what had happened is the vehicle had gotten very cold on the top and it actually

55:21.540 --> 55:29.060
made the orbiter if I can exaggerate a bit shaped a little bit like a banana like this same thing

55:29.060 --> 55:34.900
happened on STS 4 due to another factor and I'll show you behind a minute but all we had to do

55:34.900 --> 55:40.900
is we just rotated the vehicle and exposed it to the sun for about four hours in the vehicle

55:40.900 --> 55:46.740
straight and back out and then we could get the doors closed since then we are very careful to

55:46.740 --> 55:52.020
ensure that that we do the proper thermal conditioning prior to entry to make sure that the

55:52.980 --> 56:01.380
the vehicle is pretty much straight let me go to the next subject another problem

56:02.420 --> 56:06.100
now this is one that in our press and I don't know what you've had it over here now but our press

56:06.100 --> 56:12.420
has completely blown this quote problem out of out of proportion and it's most of you that are

56:12.420 --> 56:18.180
probably dealt with large aircraft with small gears breaks our problem because you've got to

56:18.180 --> 56:25.060
dissipate an awful lot of energy into some fairly small area this system those statters there's

56:25.060 --> 56:32.500
three of them the rotors there's four and they rotate concurrently inside each other and then

56:32.500 --> 56:39.780
there's eight pucks that is just a big disc brake eight pucks push on one side and there are four

56:39.780 --> 56:44.660
pucks on each of two hydraulic systems so in case you lose a hydraulic system you still got

56:44.660 --> 56:51.940
half your brakes and what has happened is we've never had a problem with the brakes stopping the

56:51.940 --> 56:56.260
vehicle they've always stopped the vehicle fine but it is a turnaround problem because we were

56:56.260 --> 57:03.860
picking up damage to the to the rotors primarily and I'll show you a picture one and it's a turnaround

57:03.860 --> 57:08.820
issue we've had to take the brakes off every time we've flown and take a look at them and expect them

57:08.820 --> 57:13.140
carefully we've made a few changes one of the problems was that axle was deflecting

57:14.100 --> 57:19.700
quite a lot it was putting some funny torques into the rotors and statters so we've stiffened

57:19.700 --> 57:27.060
that up with some saddles and we're seeing less and less damage all the time in fact the last flight

57:27.060 --> 57:33.460
which this is not a picture but the last flight we saw virtually no damage at all you can see here a

57:33.460 --> 57:39.380
clip and I'm going to show you different being a minute but there's a clip meant right here these

57:40.340 --> 57:47.940
these are the rotors one two three four and one of these clips here is bent I'll show you a picture

57:47.940 --> 57:56.340
from the side now this looks pretty bad these are burillion discs and they are faced with with

57:56.340 --> 58:03.940
carbon to between the pads if you will and this was the worst break with the worst rotor that we

58:03.940 --> 58:10.340
had you can see that the burillion actually here I can't get my barrel that how is that going

58:10.340 --> 58:17.300
off right here actually broke and we had another brake here in the burillion we had a number of clips

58:17.300 --> 58:24.340
and all that were destroyed but even on this flight the braking weren't just fine and in fact

58:24.340 --> 58:30.660
it's all contained so it can't go anywhere but it is a turnaround issue we think we're on the

58:31.300 --> 58:38.260
that's one that we haven't completely fixed yet on the last flight we had just a little bit of

58:39.060 --> 58:48.100
galling on this on these carbon facing plates if you will and we had a couple of rivets that had

58:48.100 --> 58:54.500
broken but that's one of the when I say a year from now I think we'll have some of the nagging things

58:54.980 --> 59:00.820
taken out I think that's one of the ones that will get completely solved now the next one is an

59:00.820 --> 59:07.700
interesting one I use the shot on the left here just to show you where it's a little bit like being

59:07.700 --> 59:14.500
up close to an elephant you can't tell what you're looking at right here is the area that on the

59:14.500 --> 59:20.180
first flight we received a big surprise it's on that ohm's pod there's the pod and right at the

59:20.180 --> 59:25.540
base of this right here which this is the vehicle sitting on the ground if you look right here you'll

59:25.540 --> 59:33.700
see a discolored area these ohm's pods are also graphite skined graphite epoxy skin now let me get

59:33.700 --> 59:41.460
you should move you on a little bit closer there's the corner of the pod and there was flow coming

59:41.460 --> 59:47.860
evidently during the entry flow was coming up through this body flap area and impinging hot gas

59:48.820 --> 59:55.380
in a way we didn't think was going to happen this caused delamination of the graphite epoxy

59:57.140 --> 01:00:03.380
quite a bit of burning although it didn't cause any any structural damage inside we did have to

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:08.340
cut that whole section out of this ohm's pod we had to remove the pod and they're just now getting

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:15.380
it back to service they had to cut it out and replay lay up the the graphite epoxy again and the way

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:22.340
we fixed it is that we just placed 25 we put 25 tile in this area we didn't try to stop the

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:28.340
flow that would have required a major design redesign or some type but we just covered this area with

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:36.420
with tile black tile and it hasn't been a problem since another problem we had looking at the

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:44.580
rear end of the vehicle sitting on the ground there is a nozzle right here a thruster we call it

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:51.300
a vernier thruster and it's very low thrust it's only 25 pound is a 25 pounder these big primary

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:57.380
thrusters for controlling attitude or 875 pounders and we really don't use them very much

01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:01.620
except near the entry on orbit they're just they're like somebody hits the vehicle with a hammer

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:07.860
every time they fire they're just they're large and they're powerful so we use these little 25 pound

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:12.420
vernier thrusters and this thing exhaust this is one of the down firing thrusters out of this

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:18.500
own spot and it exhausts down and if you can see a light area right in here on this is the body

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:23.700
flap and you these are black tile back in here and you can see a light area and if you look over here

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:30.580
you can see where this exhaust products were hitting on top of the body flap and it was peeling off

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:36.260
the it was just literally taking the coating off the off the tile so what we did very simple fix

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:42.260
again to show you don't always have to be really excited we just have in later vehicles we

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:50.820
butter if you will our TV 10th of an inch thick over the top of this entire area right in here

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:56.100
and just let the stuffing pinch and the rtv protects the coating of the tile and

01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:03.700
and it lines up being a super fix with very simple process they just painted on almost like a brush

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:09.940
and we look at it each flight and inspect it and then replace it if we have to we have another tile problem

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:19.540
this is meant to be a continuous picture so I didn't quite make it if you'll notice here on

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:25.860
sds 2 there's there's actually six coatings on tiles this was sitting on the lake bed after the

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:36.420
landing one two three four five six before this flight we had some particularly heavy rain and we had

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:42.740
used essentially scotch guard to waterproof the tiles in fact it's it was actually done out of

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:49.140
spray cans which was the technique we were going to use because it was simple we knew we after

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:53.860
the heat of reentry it burns off the scotch guards so we knew that we would have to to do something

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:59.540
flight to flight but we got it scotch guard and then we found out that it you know we had some very

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:03.540
very heavy rain hold we're sitting on the pad and what happened is we actually trapped we got a

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:09.380
little leakage in some tiles and we trapped some water under the coating and then in the mission during

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:15.940
the mission this area because of the attitude we were in got down below minus 100 degrees f

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:23.220
and with the freezing of that water with no way to get out quickly it literally popped the top

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:29.540
off these black tile I got a picture of the close up here you can you can see how it just peeled off the

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:37.300
the coating and very jagged shapes and it was because of the trapped water and what we've done since then

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:43.380
is we developed a new method of waterproofing and we actually waterproof internal to the tile

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:49.860
we actually went around and on each tile put a hyperdermic type of needle through the coating

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:56.660
very small hole and injected hexa-methyl dizalazine and all of that means anything to you either it

01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:03.140
doesn't make but I tried to find a commercial main point there isn't it but this material actually

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:09.620
is absorbed by the tile through the small hole and we're using the same hole each flight now there's

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:14.820
actually a machine that goes through and and puts this thing in and it's actually worked very well

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:22.100
as rapid it's they can they can do it very fast again you just can't stand now that it on this

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:27.300
leading edge if you look closer it got hot enough that there's some swamping of the tile but it

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:32.500
didn't hurt anything behind it there are some areas particularly in that chin area where you couldn't

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:38.500
take this kind of damage but you could take it and it would do some damage you probably live through

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:48.260
but you sure would hurt the vehicle in the process final very own tile if you look on the left in

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:56.340
this area this looks a little bit like salt and pepper area and what here what happened is sitting

01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:03.700
on the pad the night before we were to launch STS-4 we had a typical Florida hailstorm and it

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:10.180
actually was enough to crack this coating on these tiles and and this is pretty much what it

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:16.420
looked like before we launched we it would have been a terrible thing to have to stop and repair

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:22.340
all this tile so what we did and this is a shot on the bottom side and it looks kind of messy but

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:28.260
it worked we actually painted with this liquid silica lute ox just painted over it to kind of

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:34.020
give it a glass finish it was mostly clear and as a result it came through the entry just fine

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:38.420
all of our thermal experts said it wouldn't it did and we ended up out of all this hail damage

01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:43.620
only having to replace two tiles and we did we paired the rest of them in place with a black coating

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:51.780
after the flight one more subject on tile I'm sorry did have one more and this was in an area

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:56.420
between the elevon on this vehicle is split and we knew there was going to be hot glass

01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:02.260
gases flowing through here so we went to an ablater because the estimates were the temperature

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:09.300
was going to get hot enough and you can see actually it really ablated in here and then but we found

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:15.220
that some of the fellows thought that we could replace that and we did on later vehicles and we

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:21.620
now retrofit them all with with some high density tile slightly higher than nine pounds per square

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:28.260
foot and they did it up we saved $550,000 of flight and quite a bit of weight that's a good kind

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:37.620
of problem so I didn't cause anything to save us some money in summary I think that that we've

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:42.740
got a system the space shuttle that works very well and I think it's going to get from here on

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:50.820
nothing but better I mentioned that we were in an infant stage we've launched 12 flights since 1981

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:55.940
we launched 12 more in the next 12 months we're going to be flying once a month for the next 12

01:06:55.940 --> 01:07:01.940
months if we can all keep our sanity and our families and everything else from going crazy

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:10.180
it'll be an interesting year for us we're planning to go to a 24 flight rate per year in 1986

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:16.500
87 time frame so about every payday we'll be launching a mission shuttle mission in the space

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:21.940
and that's a terrible thought to think of having to do it that often but we're ready for it

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:28.980
I guess one person might some person people might ask why you doing it and well for one thing we

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:34.820
think it's a very capable and flexible system but there's another reason and that is and I'm just

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:38.820
going to tickle you with this one I'm not going to talk much about it but that's because of this

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:45.620
device the space station this is the this is hot off the press as I left Houston I brought it with me

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:51.540
shows an orbiter dock to what we think is going to be close to the final configuration for space

01:07:51.540 --> 01:08:01.940
station we call it the power tower because it's a rather long a long spine if you will that holds

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:08.340
solar panels radiators these are radiators right here to radiate the heat and all the living modules

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:14.100
are down in this area there's a large communication platform you see the shuttle docked up to it here

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:23.300
with the space station I think we'll have the infrastructure established for a truly operational

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:28.980
system shuttle without station and station without shuttle really don't mix too well in fact they're

01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:34.500
not either one of them are ends in themselves but together they form a very very capable

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:42.100
thing for the for the free world to have as a unit we will use this thing as a waste station

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:48.020
we will station satellites there to be later launched on to higher altitudes we will use it for

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:56.180
a scientific observatory we'll use it for metals or materials testing and we'll use it for

01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:01.380
maintaining a preeminence in a free world for for space technology I was telling someone

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:07.540
earlier this afternoon with the shuttle we pretty well kind of built the the highway if you will

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:14.260
and now we've got to build some some filling stations petrol stations and we've got to build some

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:22.020
places to stop and do some things without just these little short bursts of of man flight certainly

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:26.340
the Russians are doing that they're they're breached strengthening it they're doing it with breached

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:31.620
strength but they are pretty much living in space now all along and they are learning a great deal

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:37.620
I know they must be and we feel that it's imperative that we do the same thing the

01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:47.300
international involvement on the space station is going to be great the in by that I mean large

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:53.220
the president has invited international participation from our friends we're seeing a lot of

01:09:53.220 --> 01:10:00.180
interest generated amongst the east of states east as an organization and at least from from

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:08.900
Germany as a unilateral let me say push the Japanese are are very interested in a very aggressive

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:18.340
they're spending a lot of time with us in Houston I hope that the UK will take the same steps

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:25.540
this country in my thinking has been a a engineering leader for many many years

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:31.540
you've had some of the best ideas you've had some of the best minds put together to do things

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:39.620
it would really be I think good for us it would be good for the pre-world to use your brain power

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:45.780
in building a device like this it's probably a 30 to 50 year facility and that's it should be

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:52.020
thought of as a facility it's not a spaceship and we need to breast best best brains that we can

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:58.980
bring to bear on the subject I know that many of you are are pushing in that direction I know

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:04.100
there's like in our country that's never easy to push these kind of rather far reaching ideas

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:11.300
but I hope that that there is some impetus amongst the technical community that can convince the

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:17.940
political community in your country to participate in a large way and we would welcome your participation

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:22.580
and hope we see it with that I will close and I thank you very much

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:35.860
we are goal for main engine start 8 7 6 we have main engine start 3 2 1 solid motor ignition

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:41.860
and lift off lift off a challenger in the first flight to repair a satellite in space to

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:49.380
clear the challenge
