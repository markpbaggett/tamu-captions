01:30.000 --> 01:40.760
Flight, the magic power that lifts man above the ground into a third dimension of reality.

01:40.760 --> 01:47.600
A man's reach should exceed his grasp, said Robert Browning, or what's the heaven for?

01:47.600 --> 01:52.400
Always man looked at the heavens and reached for flight.

01:52.400 --> 01:59.280
Icarus, the legendary man who first dared to fly, was doomed, but the dream persisted.

01:59.280 --> 02:04.920
To almost everything man made, he gave imaginary wings to ships, chairs,

02:04.920 --> 02:10.960
horseless carriages as if he asked that they would somehow fly.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.480
But the forces of gravity were stubborn.

02:29.280 --> 02:50.440
An early success was reported by Alexander Graham Bell in 1896.

02:50.440 --> 02:55.600
I witnessed, he said, a remarkable experiment with Professor Langley's erodrome under

02:55.600 --> 02:57.200
Potomac River.

02:57.200 --> 03:01.080
He resembled an enormous bird soaring in the air.

03:01.080 --> 03:06.160
When the steam gave out the propellers which had moved it, stopped, and the hole instead

03:06.160 --> 03:12.240
of tumbling down, settled as slowly and as gracefully as it is possible for any bird to

03:12.240 --> 03:14.920
do it.

03:14.920 --> 03:20.120
Then two brothers, Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright of Dayton, Ohio, presented to the

03:20.120 --> 03:25.880
commissioner of patents a petition, praying for the grant of letters of patent for an alleged

03:25.880 --> 03:30.200
new and useful improvement in flying machines.

03:30.200 --> 03:35.760
In December 1903, they telegraphed home to report success.

03:35.760 --> 03:41.920
Four flights Thursday morning, all against 21 mile wind, started from level with engine

03:41.920 --> 03:51.560
power alone, average speed through air 31 miles in form press, home for Christmas.

03:51.560 --> 03:57.680
Engroge and Ospasels can blur the memory of the chilly December day, two shivering bicycle

03:57.680 --> 04:02.440
mechanics from Dayton, Ohio, first felt their home made contraption whittled out of

04:02.440 --> 04:08.360
acoustics, gummed together with Einstein's bicycle cement, stretched with muslin they'd

04:08.360 --> 04:13.840
sewn on their sisters sewing machine, saw into the air above the dunes and the wide

04:13.840 --> 04:17.840
beach at Kitty Hawk.

04:17.840 --> 04:25.040
Years before that flight at Kitty Hawk, a Frenchman, Louis Mouillard, predicted when the

04:25.040 --> 04:30.760
first fear has been conquered, when the horror of empty space has been mastered through

04:30.760 --> 04:37.400
familiarity with it, intelligent man, after having reproduced all the gates of the bird,

04:37.400 --> 04:39.720
will want to improve upon them.

04:39.720 --> 04:44.960
And he did, and a vast love affair developed between man and his flying machine.

04:47.840 --> 05:02.320
It was an age of heroes and heroic flights, records were set only to fall and be replaced,

05:02.320 --> 05:06.120
records for speed, altitude, distance.

05:06.120 --> 05:12.040
Greatest of all, the record flight made by a young American in 1927.

05:12.040 --> 05:17.880
Paris, May 26, 10 o'clock struck, a sort of shiver went through the crowd.

05:17.880 --> 05:23.400
All of a sudden the thousands were electrified by the sound of a motor, and turning we saw

05:23.400 --> 05:29.480
just as if thrown on a silver screen, a white grey monoplane, 20 feet from the ground,

05:29.480 --> 05:34.160
and softly settling, a new age was born.

05:34.160 --> 05:40.840
A bird Leonardo da Vinci observed is an instrument working according to mathematical law, which

05:40.840 --> 05:52.040
instrument it is within the capacity of man to reproduce with all its movements.

05:52.040 --> 05:58.840
According to mathematical law, today the art of flying has become the science of aeronautics,

05:58.840 --> 06:08.720
as man studies the phenomena and the laws of flight, step by experimental step.

06:08.720 --> 06:20.200
The first successful planes only the Beres theory gave birth.

06:20.200 --> 06:26.320
In just a few years aeronautics moved to flight at supersonic speeds, as research planes

06:26.320 --> 06:30.720
touched the dark edge of space.

06:30.720 --> 06:54.440
A instant progress, a flashing red warning light, a massive wind generator begins to turn.

06:54.440 --> 07:01.280
Through a labyrinth of pipes and tubes, a surge of air accelerates.

07:01.280 --> 07:09.880
In the test section, several times the speed of sound, instruments sense the reactions, forces,

07:09.880 --> 07:15.840
pressures, dynamics, temperatures, torrents of data.

07:15.840 --> 07:22.560
Computers store airplane designs as mathematical models, displayed under manned in Beres' attitudes.

07:25.280 --> 07:29.120
Tiny currents race through a maze of circuitry.

07:29.120 --> 07:34.560
Research data stored, searched, and analyzed in milliseconds.

07:34.560 --> 07:38.840
The designers' imagination interacting with the electronic brain.

07:54.440 --> 08:01.440
The first time the machine was discovered, the first time the machine was discovered,

08:01.440 --> 08:06.440
the first time the machine was discovered, the first time the machine was discovered,

08:06.440 --> 08:11.440
the first time the machine was discovered, the first time the machine was discovered,

08:11.440 --> 08:17.440
the first time the machine was discovered, the first time the machine was discovered,

08:17.440 --> 08:31.440
In the creative dialogue between man and machine, successive steps are recorded by computer-directed plotting machines.

08:47.440 --> 09:03.000
The

09:03.000 --> 09:09.720
mathematical models translated into wind tunnel models of titanium and steel, the loop

09:09.720 --> 09:14.840
the

09:39.720 --> 09:54.400
As a concept matures, research aircraft add flight experience and verify the design,

09:54.400 --> 09:59.560
the interaction of parts during all phases of flight.

09:59.560 --> 10:09.560
The optimum compromise is the mature design.

10:09.560 --> 10:15.800
As aviation more and more becomes an inescapable part of modern life, researchers turn to a broad

10:15.800 --> 10:18.720
range of problems.

10:18.720 --> 10:23.480
How to reduce jet engine noise?

10:23.480 --> 10:26.040
How to make runways safer?

10:26.040 --> 10:30.680
The turbulent wakes left in the sky by large planes.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.960
How to build stronger and safer airplanes.

10:33.960 --> 10:38.480
Shock waves and the sonic boom.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.720
Flight experience remains crucial.

10:40.720 --> 10:48.560
In various test programs, airplanes of many kinds are used to verify and improve design concepts.

10:48.560 --> 10:53.960
As our cities grow and expand, it becomes ever more difficult to get from place to place.

10:53.960 --> 11:02.240
In actual flight and in tests, concepts for short and vertical take-off and landing are developed.

11:02.240 --> 11:11.320
Such airplanes may link downtown to downtown, city to airport and town to country.

11:11.320 --> 11:17.880
Continent to continent, research programs investigate flight at ever greater speeds, ever higher

11:17.880 --> 11:18.880
altitudes.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.840
New York to Paris in two hours.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.520
New York to Tokyo in six.

11:24.520 --> 11:29.800
Quiet as safer and more efficient as time and distance shrink.

11:29.800 --> 11:33.240
Only a few decades since Skitty Hawk.

11:33.240 --> 11:39.880
The airplanes of tomorrow fly and wind tunnels today at six, eight, ten times the speed of

11:39.880 --> 11:41.680
sound.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.520
More and more people fly.

11:43.520 --> 11:49.680
More often and more planes to more places, millions today, tens of millions tomorrow.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.480
The greatest migration in history.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.480
The future of aviation.

11:54.480 --> 11:58.600
Will it bring more crowding, pollution, noise, or?

11:58.600 --> 12:03.680
Will it bring us closer together into the family of man?

12:03.680 --> 12:11.000
Computers and wind tunnels, circuits and switches, dials and gauges, new tools for research, and

12:11.000 --> 12:14.920
man the designer looking into the future.

12:14.920 --> 12:22.880
Research today is solving tomorrow's problems to fulfill the promise of flight, a new freedom

12:22.880 --> 12:24.280
for man.

12:24.280 --> 12:30.720
A man's reach should exceed his grasp, the long impossible dream to cross the threshold

12:30.720 --> 12:33.120
of space has become reality.

13:24.280 --> 13:38.520
As this mission unfolds, it carries with it the dreams of centuries, the science of

13:38.520 --> 13:43.920
300 years and a decade of experience in space flight.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.760
Sputnik the first satellite.

13:46.760 --> 13:54.360
Man himself, Yuri Gagarin, Alan Shepard, John Glenn, Valentina Tereshkova, a woman in

13:54.360 --> 14:02.000
space, man walks in space, the intricate ballet of rendezvous and docking.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.440
Space, a new field for science.

14:05.440 --> 14:10.560
Sense-saws pointed at the Earth, the Sun, the stars.

14:10.560 --> 14:16.040
Weather surveillance, communications, agriculture, earth resources, and many other fields benefit

14:16.040 --> 14:18.440
from satellite research.

14:18.440 --> 14:23.040
Before man went to the moon, unmanned spacecraft made the voyage.

14:23.040 --> 14:29.720
Luna and Lunic, Ranger and Sevea, camera shutters clicking from lunar orbiters to map the

14:29.720 --> 14:31.960
moon and select landing signs.

14:46.040 --> 14:58.640
In the long period of research and development that led to the landing on the moon, each step

14:58.640 --> 15:21.440
to be taken on the way and on the moon itself was carefully rehearsed.

15:29.640 --> 15:39.080
Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon, July 1969, A.D., it was a small

15:39.080 --> 15:51.960
step, a giant leap, they came in peace for all mankind.

15:51.960 --> 16:01.080
The astronauts found, as astronomer Fred Whipple had predicted, a sublime desolation.

16:01.080 --> 16:06.920
To this strange world they came as explorers and scientists.

16:06.920 --> 16:11.760
There had been concern about man's ability to work in the weak lunar gravity, but the

16:11.760 --> 16:17.720
astronauts reported, there seems to be no difficulty in moving around here and we suspect

16:17.720 --> 16:23.800
it's even easier than the simulations of 1 6 G that we performed in various simulators

16:23.800 --> 16:26.680
on the ground.

16:26.680 --> 16:34.600
Man comes to the moon with questions, questions he asks of the soil, the rocks, and the terrain,

16:34.600 --> 16:40.120
of the things he sees and experiences and records.

16:40.120 --> 16:47.120
And he asks, with the instruments he leaves behind.

16:47.120 --> 16:56.680
Information radioed back to Earth may answer age-old questions, what is the origin, the evolution

16:56.680 --> 17:00.080
of the moon, the Earth, the solar system?

17:00.080 --> 17:07.000
New questions arise, the moon becomes a laboratory, scientists of many nations share in its

17:07.000 --> 17:10.720
discoveries.

17:10.720 --> 17:18.200
A sublime desolation, a laboratory for science, it is in truth for all mankind.

17:37.000 --> 18:07.000
The Earth is a laboratory for science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science

18:07.000 --> 18:07.560
Science, science, science, science science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science, science

18:37.000 --> 18:45.000
Constantine Silkotsky was a shy deaf school teacher and one of the pioneers of space science.

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
Earth, he said, is the cradle of the mind, but one cannot live in the cradle forever.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
To leave the cradle, new and more efficient concepts of spaceflight are being developed.

18:58.000 --> 19:05.000
A space shuttle system, spacecraft which will operate in space and in the atmosphere.

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
Return to Earth to land on runways and be used again.

19:11.000 --> 19:24.000
Space stations will be scientific outposts in Earth orbit, platforms for instruments to survey the Earth and observe the heavens and laboratories for the space technology of tomorrow.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.000
Teams of scientists and engineers will live and work here for long periods of time.

19:30.000 --> 19:36.000
Looking at the heavens, man asks the age-old question, is anyone there?

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
The reason for going to Mars really is to get on the surface of the planet, right?

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
We're interested in how the planet was formed, where it came from in the first place.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
What is the physical environment of the planet?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
And of course the by-life.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
He's their life on the planet.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Does the planet tell us anything about where how wind life begins?

19:56.000 --> 20:08.000
The voices of scientists, geologists, meteorologists, biologists, mapping the exploration of another planet with project biking.

20:08.000 --> 20:17.000
An unmanned space probe landing on Mars, a robot laboratory to conduct experiments and look for life.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
When you think about how to look for life, you do what every human being does,

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
who's ever been alone on a desert. The first thing he does, he opens his eyes and he looks around.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
And he looks with the experience that he's had for the length of his life.

20:32.000 --> 20:40.000
He tries to see if there's a shrub or a bush or a rattle or something, something to give him some credibility to it.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
How about red grass?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
It's just red grass on Earth, that's no challenge.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
The life detection experiment, it's really four experiments.

20:47.000 --> 20:57.000
And because life is such a complicated process, the more criteria of biological activity we can look for, the more likely we are to find it.

20:57.000 --> 21:07.000
For example, there's the experiment that deals with photosynthesis, where you actually inject some carbon dioxide and see whether the carbon dioxide is picked up by the sunlight.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
But when people are introduced into an experiment, they're so simple.

21:11.000 --> 21:18.000
But think of the difficulty replacing the human and trying to make a robot, a machine that goes someplace and does something for us.

21:18.000 --> 21:28.000
We're taking what are very simple, laboratory routines, and we have to do all of this in a completely automated mode.

21:28.000 --> 21:34.000
But the thing that really turns me on is the idea that there might be a separate and distinct origin of life on Mars.

21:35.000 --> 21:43.000
If you really had it happen twice in this tiny little sun solar system that we have, what universe must be teeming with life.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
And if that's true, who are we to say that we're the smart ones?

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
We may be somewhere in the middle, one is always in the middle of some curve.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
It's like the days of the Vikings, the real Vikings. It's an exploratory program.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
And new questions always produce more new questions, and this is how you learn.

22:01.000 --> 22:09.000
And beyond this tiny little sun solar system, islands floating in the great void is anyone there.

22:09.000 --> 22:21.000
Nebulae, clusters, galaxies, father and father. But where man has never been and may in fact never go, his mind has already reached out to ask questions.

22:22.000 --> 22:33.000
Digital computers spin out data, gravitation, velocity, energy, mass. The life cycles of universes compressed into minutes.

22:35.000 --> 22:46.000
As man looks outward into the darkness of space and finds the light of new knowledge, he sees and begins to understand himself.

22:47.000 --> 23:04.000
Archibald McLeish comments to see the earth as it truly is small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together.

23:04.000 --> 23:13.000
Brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold. Brothers who know now that they are truly brothers.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
And Qing Da Ji, slides into a heaven's warm air.

24:19.000 --> 24:27.000
One brave boy knocks on basin, continues, driven by the god Winter demon.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.700
echts

24:44.300 --> 24:45.540
la un

24:45.540 --> 24:49.580
I'm Jim Bernett and I'm your host for the next several weeks.

24:49.580 --> 24:52.060
Our series is the airplane and NASA.

24:52.060 --> 24:57.420
We'll trace how NASA, building on the previous work of NACA, the National Advisory Committee

24:57.420 --> 25:01.940
for Aeronautics, has played an important role in the field of Aeronautics.

25:01.940 --> 25:07.100
In this, our first show, a prominent figure in the world of aviation, Paul Garber, shares

25:07.100 --> 25:09.620
some of his experiences with us.

25:09.620 --> 25:14.100
He takes us back to the very first days of Powered Plate, and he gives valuable insight

25:14.100 --> 25:16.700
into the growth of airplane technology.

25:16.700 --> 25:22.100
In later programs, we pick up the NASA Aeronautical story in the 60s and move chronologically

25:22.100 --> 25:24.180
from then towards the present.

25:24.180 --> 25:28.580
Now let's pick up the Garber interview as he talks about the films he's made on the

25:28.580 --> 25:29.580
history of flight.

25:29.580 --> 25:33.980
I started off with natural flight because flight began with nature.

25:33.980 --> 25:38.580
Two hundred and fifty million years ago, with the first bug that flew, the Megadora.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.340
Two hundred and fifty million years ago.

25:41.340 --> 25:46.260
And then, after natural flight, he made a magician flight as the next one.

25:46.260 --> 25:50.740
Man's journey to fly, as shown in his imagination, where he couldn't make the thing, but he

25:50.740 --> 25:52.260
could think about it.

25:52.260 --> 25:56.260
It's quite significant that he thought that angels could fly and that the guards could

25:56.260 --> 26:00.820
fly because he thought that the guards could do anything.

26:00.820 --> 26:05.580
Take Mercury or Hermes, the messenger of the guards, who had wings, little things on his

26:05.580 --> 26:07.580
feet, not his helmet.

26:07.580 --> 26:13.300
Not much very powerful wing loading, but it was an idea, quite important, that man had

26:13.300 --> 26:14.300
eyes.

26:14.300 --> 26:15.980
Everything starts with a good idea.

26:15.980 --> 26:25.220
So the imaginative flight, that's with religion, fantasy, fiction, poetry, art.

26:25.220 --> 26:30.780
And then the kite, the boomerang, then DaVinci.

26:37.580 --> 26:50.060
Then, the balloon was the first lift man into the air, that was November 21, 1783, the

26:50.060 --> 26:52.900
Mocophie in France, Paris.

26:52.900 --> 26:58.360
And then, airships, which are power balloons, and then the beginnings of heavy-length air

26:58.360 --> 27:02.940
crypt, going back to Landoin, Bienvenu, 1784, were the first thing that ever raised

27:02.940 --> 27:11.940
his self by his own self-contained power, first step beyond the kite.

27:11.940 --> 27:14.500
A kite is far more than a toy.

27:14.500 --> 27:18.060
It can be a very interesting lesson in basic aerodynamics.

27:18.060 --> 27:27.220
It can show you things about center of thrust, center of gravity, and center of the pressure.

27:27.220 --> 27:31.780
And it can tell you things about dihedral for its lateral stability and of keel service

27:31.780 --> 27:33.980
for longitudinal stability.

27:33.980 --> 27:50.820
It's a very good teaching device.

27:50.820 --> 27:55.820
I saw it in the newspaper where the light was flying at Fort Myra, this picture of the

27:55.820 --> 27:59.060
airplane and the statement about the flight.

27:59.620 --> 28:03.180
My husband followed if I could have car-fear to go to Fort Myra the next day.

28:03.180 --> 28:06.020
He gave me 50 cents or whatever it was.

28:06.020 --> 28:10.300
The next morning or next afternoon it was because it said the flying was late in the afternoon

28:10.300 --> 28:12.580
when the wind had died down.

28:12.580 --> 28:14.780
So I went over to Fort Myra.

28:14.780 --> 28:18.940
The man with a trotting line was caught in distance away from the fort, but I ran all the

28:18.940 --> 28:20.540
way.

28:20.540 --> 28:25.940
And as I came to the fort and went through the gate, I could hear this sound.

28:25.940 --> 28:31.660
And as I passed the first short block and then came out where the huge field was, where

28:31.660 --> 28:35.820
they had the archivalry and cavalry exercises.

28:35.820 --> 28:41.300
Here looking down I saw the sound, the sort of this noise, and it was this airplane.

28:41.300 --> 28:44.700
I'd never been before seen an airplane, I've seen pictures of them.

28:44.700 --> 28:49.140
But here was this enormous thing, this great big kite with two men in it.

28:49.140 --> 28:55.060
And the propeller is turning over and the engine was sound and coming towards us.

28:55.060 --> 28:59.540
As I looked at it, I'd even back like that and felt down flat but continued to look at

28:59.540 --> 29:05.780
it and then got up and watched it as a flew around and around and around the field going

29:05.780 --> 29:07.100
this way I've ever.

29:07.100 --> 29:10.140
And then finally came into a landing.

29:10.140 --> 29:17.820
Now that memory has been enhanced by later knowledge so that I know now that it was on

29:17.820 --> 29:22.980
the 27th of July, 1999 because that was the day of the duration of flight.

29:22.980 --> 29:25.940
And the 30th was the day of the distance flight.

29:25.940 --> 29:31.660
That was the first round trip flight in America when the orbit right flew from Fort Meyer to

29:31.660 --> 29:36.140
Alexandria around Souter-Sea along back again, ten miles in all.

29:36.140 --> 29:42.300
Yes, that remains to my mind as well I can look right through a 747 and see the light

29:42.300 --> 29:43.580
flyer.

29:43.580 --> 29:49.500
And then I was further astonished when I saw the airplane again in the Smithsonian where

29:49.500 --> 29:51.940
it had been placed in 1911.

29:51.940 --> 29:58.100
So many times I would go there just to see the airplane once more.

29:58.100 --> 30:04.260
One day when I was again visiting the Smithsonian, I saw a one-top of a case, this rather large

30:04.260 --> 30:06.420
scale model of a Shannouge glider.

30:06.420 --> 30:10.860
I learned later that Octav Shannouge himself had given it to the Smithsonian, following

30:10.860 --> 30:15.540
its use in a display in 1906 and with the first air show in America.

30:15.540 --> 30:16.540
So there it was.

30:16.540 --> 30:21.340
And I got permission to go up on a ladder where the man was peeing in the case.

30:21.340 --> 30:25.340
And I looked at it more closely and see how it was made and get an idea about his dimensions.

30:25.340 --> 30:28.380
I went on home and made a copy of it.

30:28.380 --> 30:35.460
It's about Yase Ben and about Yay Cord and had an extended boom arrangement with a

30:35.460 --> 30:37.660
quadriff oil tail on it.

30:37.660 --> 30:38.980
I made a copy of it.

30:38.980 --> 30:41.780
My mother helped me to tack the cloth on.

30:41.780 --> 30:44.420
She had what was called chints in those days.

30:44.420 --> 30:45.740
Today they called it polished cotton.

30:45.740 --> 30:48.740
She had a whole boat of red chints.

30:48.740 --> 30:53.020
We covered it with that and then I went out in the backyard and assembled it.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.820
And then my model airplane club friends got together.

30:55.820 --> 31:00.620
We just flew it over the fence on the Plahill to a place called the Red Lot.

31:00.620 --> 31:04.140
It was just red gravel, a lot of this red clay.

31:04.140 --> 31:11.380
And three big trees at the back end of it, we chose a windy day and I got in this glider

31:11.380 --> 31:16.940
or on it or under it, had my arms over the lingerons and my hands grasping the two

31:16.940 --> 31:18.700
struts here.

31:18.700 --> 31:25.020
And we had two lines going out from it with my friends on each line and a good wind.

31:25.020 --> 31:28.900
And then I hovered to them to pull and I began running with this thing.

31:28.900 --> 31:33.420
And sure enough I began to rise and they were so surprised to see me rise.

31:33.420 --> 31:34.620
They stopped running to look.

31:34.620 --> 31:40.620
And of course we stood back on the glider's tail and my tail and took a couple of weeks

31:40.620 --> 31:42.700
for repairs to both of us.

31:42.700 --> 31:48.020
But then we went again to the same location and they kept running that time.

31:48.020 --> 31:53.500
They ran to the end of the field and then down this rather steep far end of it.

31:53.500 --> 31:59.380
And then I glided above them and then over this lower section and across the trees and

31:59.380 --> 32:01.900
let it in the field on the far side.

32:01.900 --> 32:07.100
And today when I'm in that area I tell my friends, I flew over those trees.

32:07.100 --> 32:08.540
The trees are way up there now.

32:08.540 --> 32:10.620
They're down here.

32:10.620 --> 32:14.380
But I mean the ballot doesn't utilize in this thing and then one of the other folks

32:14.380 --> 32:16.980
wanted to try it and he cracked it up.

32:16.980 --> 32:29.660
But that was the first time I was airborne, my team 15.

32:29.660 --> 32:35.140
Air mail had begun at the Porto Grounds in Washington on May 15, 1918.

32:35.140 --> 32:39.340
That is as a continuously scheduled public service between six stations.

32:39.340 --> 32:44.660
And then air mail before that with the carrier pigeons and bulldoons and the pioneers of flight.

32:44.660 --> 32:49.940
But the first time that it became a public service started what we now have today was this

32:49.940 --> 32:53.860
route between Washington and New York.

32:53.860 --> 33:00.060
And the army began it on May 15 and then turned it over to the post office on August 12.

33:00.060 --> 33:05.060
And I signed up when I got my discharge on December 14th.

33:05.060 --> 33:11.660
I was a professional discharge at is and then was signed in on the 17th, which has happened

33:11.660 --> 33:16.180
to be the 15th anniversary of the right for this first flight.

33:16.180 --> 33:20.380
And I was at College Park at the big field there.

33:20.380 --> 33:23.220
And I was by no means a route pilot.

33:23.220 --> 33:25.180
I have such admiration for those who were.

33:25.180 --> 33:27.660
I wouldn't elute them by myself.

33:27.660 --> 33:32.340
But I learned to fly at that time because many of those pilots had been instructors and

33:32.340 --> 33:34.900
they gave me some stick time once in a while.

33:34.900 --> 33:39.300
And I sold on the Fourth of July the holiday of 1919.

33:39.300 --> 33:42.140
Sold it in the Curtis Jenny.

33:42.140 --> 33:43.460
And I helped with the mail.

33:43.460 --> 33:45.580
I was very proud that to do my part.

33:45.580 --> 33:46.580
I'd do anything.

33:46.580 --> 33:48.500
They call me Chief Slave.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.500
And I'd do anything.

33:49.500 --> 33:55.300
I'd gas up the ships or check the tool bag and taxi out the airplane that is run alongside

33:55.300 --> 33:59.380
of it or grab it as it came in, up the whole to wing.

33:59.380 --> 34:00.980
And the mechanics work.

34:00.980 --> 34:04.020
Worked on the engines on the airframes.

34:04.020 --> 34:06.980
I was handy.

34:06.980 --> 34:11.780
You know Paul, you've been at the Smithsonian Institution since 1920.

34:11.780 --> 34:16.180
When you first joined the Smithsonian, what were some of your first duties?

34:16.180 --> 34:18.300
I was called preparator.

34:18.300 --> 34:21.980
That means one who prepares things for display.

34:21.980 --> 34:26.100
And my job was to repair things that had broken.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.100
And there were many things.

34:27.100 --> 34:29.820
In fact, that's how I got the idea that I might work there.

34:29.820 --> 34:32.540
I'd been to the Air Vale Service prior to that.

34:32.540 --> 34:35.260
But then I came for another position.

34:35.260 --> 34:37.740
After I left the Air and mail, we loved it.

34:37.740 --> 34:39.460
Because they were moving to Chicago.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.820
And I was to be based in Washington.

34:41.820 --> 34:42.980
My father was not well.

34:42.980 --> 34:45.340
Asked me to stay in this area.

34:45.340 --> 34:51.140
But at Smithsonian, there were many things that were broken.

34:51.140 --> 34:58.220
So wanting another job and loving that institution as I always have, I asked if a permission, if

34:58.220 --> 34:59.860
a job might be available.

35:03.540 --> 35:09.780
And I met Luther Reed, who had been language-cheap mechanic on his large air drum.

35:09.780 --> 35:11.780
And on the small air drums also.

35:11.780 --> 35:14.740
You see, Langley was the secretary of the Smithsonian.

35:14.740 --> 35:17.180
That means the head.

35:17.180 --> 35:24.740
And the Langley Air drum, unmanned of 1896, was the world's first ever heavier than aircraft

35:24.740 --> 35:28.060
to be mechanically powered and to fly.

35:28.060 --> 35:31.780
And then, later on, the manned aircraft did not fly.

35:31.780 --> 35:33.580
But the unmanned one did.

35:33.580 --> 35:36.100
So Luther Reed was language-cheap mechanic.

35:36.100 --> 35:40.220
And he was still living when I used to go there just to see the museum.

35:40.220 --> 35:42.020
I came to meet him.

35:42.020 --> 35:43.300
He loved clocks also.

35:43.300 --> 35:47.220
I tried to get there around 12 o'clock when all the clocks were striking.

35:47.220 --> 35:49.180
And I'd take him to my screen.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.020
So he died in March.

35:51.020 --> 35:55.020
I got his job in June, June 1, 1920.

35:55.020 --> 35:58.860
And my duties were to repair things, a preparatory.

35:58.860 --> 36:01.780
I'd repair anything.

36:01.780 --> 36:04.060
But then my interest was in aeronautics.

36:04.060 --> 36:08.900
And whenever I could finish one job and had nothing assigned to me, I'd work on something

36:08.900 --> 36:10.420
aeronautical.

36:10.420 --> 36:13.820
So this was a three-month appointment.

36:13.820 --> 36:15.540
And it began to run out.

36:15.540 --> 36:17.900
And the boss was away on vacation.

36:17.900 --> 36:24.140
So finishing everything that I've been told to do, up to the time when I, with my last

36:24.140 --> 36:29.900
day of bored, had arrived, I then continued to work there, but making this model of

36:29.900 --> 36:32.220
the aeronautics event she's manual on a thupter.

36:32.220 --> 36:36.220
That's a wing flipper.

36:36.220 --> 36:40.780
On a thupter, on a from bird, and thupter from wing.

36:40.780 --> 36:41.780
Bird wing job.

36:41.780 --> 36:43.820
And the aeronautics event she was my hero.

36:43.820 --> 36:44.820
I'd always admire the man.

36:44.820 --> 36:48.260
I had the greatest mind I think it ever existed.

36:48.260 --> 36:51.100
And he was interested in flight.

36:51.100 --> 36:56.880
So DaVinci marks the separation between the crazy ideas, like two bottles that were,

36:56.880 --> 37:02.900
they thought those were magic to arise, and heart-assing birds, when human power was applied

37:02.900 --> 37:05.580
in a sensible manner to operating an aircraft.

37:05.580 --> 37:11.140
And I learned more about this from the librarian of the Smithsonian and then made this model,

37:11.140 --> 37:16.820
just on my own, because I wanted to house something there of my own that I had made just

37:17.820 --> 37:21.260
to, so my grandchildren when I came there in later years.

37:21.260 --> 37:24.260
But the secretary, who was then Dr. Walkett.

37:24.260 --> 37:27.940
In fact, Walkett was really the founder of what you are here.

37:27.940 --> 37:31.540
He was the founder of NACA, which is now NASA.

37:31.540 --> 37:37.540
Dr. Walkett saw this model admired it and gave me an extension, which has lasted for

37:37.540 --> 37:41.900
61 and some months years.

37:42.900 --> 37:47.620
So I was a model maker, I was a model repairer.

37:47.620 --> 37:51.540
I'd do anything that had to be done to maintain the collection.

37:51.540 --> 37:57.900
But then, when I'd helped to get the spirit of St. Louis, that brought so much attention

37:57.900 --> 38:03.460
to the agricultural collections of the museum, that it was decided to have a section of aeronolics

38:03.460 --> 38:05.460
now is pretty in charge of it.

38:12.900 --> 38:19.900
So over your 61 years, Paul, no doubt you've met and talked with many famous aviators.

38:19.900 --> 38:24.900
I'm going to mention a few names and maybe if you could just kind of highlight which

38:24.900 --> 38:25.900
you remember about each one.

38:25.900 --> 38:26.900
Charles Lindbergh.

38:26.900 --> 38:31.900
I've known other than as an airmail pilot because I've been in the airmail myself.

38:31.900 --> 38:37.900
And I'd known of him with his service on this Chicago St. Louis route.

38:37.900 --> 38:39.900
Because he was a very fine pilot.

38:39.900 --> 38:43.020
I love him through mutual friends.

38:43.020 --> 38:46.900
And then I came to know him after he had agreed to give the airplane to us.

38:46.900 --> 38:50.900
I met him in Memphis when he was on his circuit tour of the United States.

38:50.900 --> 38:53.900
I met him when he came to the museum to discuss it.

38:53.900 --> 38:57.900
Of course, I met him when he brought it to us on April 30, 1928.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.900
I met him when he visited the museum many times.

39:00.900 --> 39:02.900
Yes, I knew him quite well.

39:02.900 --> 39:05.900
He always called me Mama first name.

39:05.900 --> 39:08.900
I was supposed to say, I forget to call him Slim.

39:08.900 --> 39:11.900
What about Orville Wright?

39:11.900 --> 39:15.900
He came to the museum in 1923.

39:15.900 --> 39:22.900
He wanted to see the Langley Air Drome and consider it aerodynamically and also to see whether

39:22.900 --> 39:26.900
he had been repaired as it is in its original condition.

39:26.900 --> 39:33.900
Of course, the Langley Air Drome, the large one, was tested twice October 7th and December 8th of 1903.

39:33.900 --> 39:35.900
Neither time to deflie.

39:35.900 --> 39:44.900
The first time, the front king post caught on the launching gear and pulled the wing down this way with a negative angle of incidence just went into the water.

39:44.900 --> 39:52.900
The second time, the rear guy broke to the stabilizer, the aircraft went up like this on its back and again in the water.

39:52.900 --> 40:01.900
We don't know but the third time was never tested again until it was tested after it had been repaired and modified by Glenn Curtis.

40:01.900 --> 40:10.900
And Orville Wright objected to the belief that the flight in 1914 proved that it might have flown in 1903.

40:10.900 --> 40:17.900
And he wanted to see the airplane again to remind himself about his details. I met him then.

40:17.900 --> 40:27.900
And I showed him a display I'd made because the 20th anniversary of the Kitty Hawk flight of 1903 was coming up again.

40:27.900 --> 40:34.900
I made this display. I made a scale model about the Kitty Hawk flyer. I had photographs of himself and his brother.

40:34.900 --> 40:40.900
I had an example of the Langley battle was given to him and his brother in 1988.

40:40.900 --> 40:44.900
Early recognition of them may have been the first in America.

40:44.900 --> 40:52.900
And then I had some other photographs of their gliders and wind tunnel.

40:52.900 --> 40:56.900
So I showed that Orville Wright and he was rather pleased to see it.

40:56.900 --> 41:03.900
And then he made a few comments of additional items that I needed. I asked him for things that I knew I wanted.

41:03.900 --> 41:07.900
He was very gracious and gave me a number of photographs for it.

41:07.900 --> 41:13.900
Made some suggestions about the model and let's start a present relationship.

41:14.900 --> 41:19.900
One of my Glenn Curtis. Of course I knew I've been from the very early days.

41:19.900 --> 41:26.900
But in 1925 I was at the air racers in New York City on Long Island.

41:26.900 --> 41:33.900
And he was there with the Curtis racers which were beautiful aircraft.

41:33.900 --> 41:44.900
And the Curtis R3C2 was being flown by Sy Bettis and with Jimmy Durittle as ultimate pilot I remember.

41:44.900 --> 41:49.900
And then our Williams was flying a similar airplane. Sy Bettis won that year.

41:49.900 --> 41:59.900
But as a contrast between the then current Curtis racers and the Curtis aircraft of the early days there was a Curtis pusher.

42:00.900 --> 42:08.900
Which was flown by Wittacosta and then as it came back and was put up here on the line, the Curtis sat at it.

42:08.900 --> 42:15.900
And after his photograph was taken I woke up, introduced myself, said I was from the museum.

42:15.900 --> 42:19.900
I said would you consider giving us a airplane to the Smithsonian?

42:19.900 --> 42:24.900
Well he said I hadn't thought of that. Well it said you're going to do something with it.

42:24.900 --> 42:29.900
And if you keep on flying it you'll bust it up about giving it to us.

42:29.900 --> 42:36.900
He called a Frank Russell who was standing by. He says Frank Paul Garver wants this airplane for his museum in Washington.

42:36.900 --> 42:40.900
And Frank Russell says that's a good idea.

42:41.900 --> 42:43.900
What about Wiley Post?

42:43.900 --> 42:49.900
Yes of course everybody knew him, the wonderful flyer that he is with only one eye.

42:49.900 --> 42:55.900
And a magnificent example of 42 determinations part of the handicap.

42:55.900 --> 42:56.900
Wonderful example.

42:56.900 --> 43:00.900
I go sometimes to see my Gerdaardor who'd become an invalid.

43:00.900 --> 43:09.900
As I see these persons there in this hospital, I wish for something that would close them to somehow try to overcome their handicap.

43:09.900 --> 43:15.900
But Wiley Post is a magnificent example, the one who was handicap by the loss of an eye.

43:15.900 --> 43:18.900
But he overcame that.

43:18.900 --> 43:24.900
One can, as I found out one time when I had an eye injury, one can regain somewhat perspective.

43:24.900 --> 43:27.900
That's what the two eyes give you of course.

43:27.900 --> 43:30.900
To some extent you get back a relationship of how far things are.

43:30.900 --> 43:36.900
But he was able to fly an airplane and to land it and fly it under the most difficult conditions.

43:36.900 --> 43:37.900
Yes I knew him.

43:37.900 --> 43:43.900
But I knew him because of who he was. And I asked him for the Winnie Mae one time over to Hoover Field.

43:43.900 --> 43:46.900
Well he says, I'm still using it.

43:46.900 --> 43:51.900
Well I said, they'll come at time when you'll be turning it in on something else and like to have it for the museum.

43:51.900 --> 43:58.900
Meanwhile I was offered other lucky Vegas like Wilkins or the one that was being flown by St. Avall.

43:58.900 --> 44:03.900
But I kept on after the Winnie Mae of Wiley Post.

44:03.900 --> 44:05.900
We finally got it.

44:05.900 --> 44:09.900
And I would never have wished to have it the way we did. That was after his death.

44:09.900 --> 44:17.900
And then Mrs. Post was gracious to give it to us with a special arrangement by Josh Lee of Oklahoma, then in Congress.

44:20.900 --> 44:24.900
Another character on the pass is Roscoe Turner with his lion Gilmore?

44:24.900 --> 44:26.900
Yes.

44:26.900 --> 44:41.900
I think I met him first when I was anxious to illustrate the beginnings of commercial aviation in the world.

44:41.900 --> 44:47.900
Aviation, that is of course era stash and was the first commercial that's light of the air.

44:47.900 --> 45:01.900
But aviation commercially began in Florida in January 11, 1914 with a Benoit flying boat flown by my good friend Tony Janis, who graduated from Tech High School as I did.

45:01.900 --> 45:04.900
Not when I did, I was some years after he.

45:04.900 --> 45:07.900
But he learned to fly at College Park where I did.

45:07.900 --> 45:11.900
And then went with Benoit, that's B-E-N-O-I-S-T.

45:11.900 --> 45:16.900
Tom Benoit used to call his factory the Benoistory because person's calling Benoit.

45:17.900 --> 45:23.900
But it was a Benoit flying boat flown by Tony Janis that was the world's first ever commercial.

45:23.900 --> 45:30.900
That was up for about three months between St. Petersburg and Tampa, which was across the hoop with his narrow bridge.

45:30.900 --> 45:33.900
In those days, those eight miles were spanned by air.

45:38.900 --> 45:40.900
And I wanted to represent the museum.

45:40.900 --> 45:43.900
I wanted to make the scale model of that flying boat.

45:43.900 --> 45:52.900
And then when I was given the model by the one who sponsored it, then Roscoe Turner was in the group.

45:52.900 --> 45:55.900
What about a million-year heart?

45:55.900 --> 45:57.900
I saw her twice.

45:57.900 --> 46:00.900
I was at Muston Field at Philadelphia.

46:00.900 --> 46:02.900
That's the Navy field up there.

46:02.900 --> 46:05.900
When she came in, had a flat tire.

46:05.900 --> 46:08.900
And I helped a little bit get it repaired.

46:08.900 --> 46:13.900
And I wrote great trophies, a little flat tire, a way in, bring it back, fixed up.

46:13.900 --> 46:15.900
A very gracious lady.

46:15.900 --> 46:22.900
And then I saw her one time at the White House when many famous pilots were being received by the President.

46:22.900 --> 46:24.900
What about Howard Hughes?

46:24.900 --> 46:33.900
When he made his marvelous flight in 1935, established a new transcontinental record, I wrote to him for his airplane.

46:34.900 --> 46:38.900
And he was reluctant to give it to us, and that's me had a place to put it on display.

46:38.900 --> 46:41.900
But that time we had no space for it.

46:41.900 --> 46:44.900
He said he would keep it until we didn't have a space for it.

46:44.900 --> 46:53.900
And one day after the war at World War II, he was walking toward me up Pennsylvania Avenue, and I recognized him.

46:53.900 --> 46:57.900
And I turned and got in step with him, introduced myself.

46:57.900 --> 47:00.900
I said, I'm the one that asked you for that airplane of yours.

47:00.900 --> 47:01.900
Where do we get it?

47:01.900 --> 47:04.900
So you'll get it when you have a place to show it.

47:04.900 --> 47:07.900
Of course we do have a place to show it now. It's beautiful.

47:07.900 --> 47:09.900
I think it's the most beautiful airplane we have.

47:09.900 --> 47:14.900
It's just as smooth as a baby's cheek, the lovely streamlining and craftsmanship on it.

47:14.900 --> 47:20.900
He says, in fact, I might fly it there because I still think it's faster than these jet jobs.

47:20.900 --> 47:22.900
Of course he never did.

47:24.900 --> 47:26.900
What about Lincoln Ellsworth?

47:26.900 --> 47:29.900
He made an Arctic and had Arctic flights.

47:29.900 --> 47:31.900
He was with Amonson in the Norge.

47:31.900 --> 47:34.900
That was the Italian airship that went over the North Pole.

47:34.900 --> 47:40.900
And then he became interested in Antarctic flying and obtained a beautiful airplane,

47:40.900 --> 47:45.900
which was one of the very first to be skin-stressed, the North of Gamma.

47:45.900 --> 47:51.900
I wanted that technically because of its characteristics and historically because of its flight to this.

47:51.900 --> 47:53.900
I asked him for that.

47:53.900 --> 47:59.900
He said, yes, but it'll still be my airplane because I still want to fly it.

47:59.900 --> 48:02.900
And he says, keep it in good shape for me.

48:02.900 --> 48:06.900
So I would. I'd pull the prop through of you now and then. I'd check the battery.

48:06.900 --> 48:10.900
It was still fly, but it's here today.

48:12.900 --> 48:14.900
I'm so impressed by what has been.

48:14.900 --> 48:19.900
When I think that when I was nine years old, I saw a white fly.

48:19.900 --> 48:22.900
When I was 69 years old, I saw a man step on the moon by television,

48:22.900 --> 48:24.900
making it all the more wonderful.

48:24.900 --> 48:27.900
And the marvelous things you've done here in NASA with this shuttle

48:27.900 --> 48:32.900
and the other tremendous exploits of going to the moon, that is the future.

48:32.900 --> 48:34.900
And you can tell that better than I.

48:34.900 --> 48:38.900
I can't predict the future. I'm too astounded at the past.

48:38.900 --> 48:46.900
That's my job. I'm supposed to be historian, Emeritus of the National Airspace Museum.

48:46.900 --> 48:53.900
I don't think there's anyone in the world that can say, hi, flight, like you can.

48:53.900 --> 48:56.900
Would you be willing to say it for us?

48:56.900 --> 49:00.900
I wish McGee were here to say it. He's the one who wrote it.

49:00.900 --> 49:03.900
He was the victim of it.

49:03.900 --> 49:10.900
He was running into another airplane and World War II crashed.

49:11.900 --> 49:17.900
Oh, I have slipped the story bonds of Earth and danced the skies on laughter-sovered wings.

49:17.900 --> 49:22.900
Sunward I've climbed and joined the tumbling birth of sunspit clouds

49:22.900 --> 49:25.900
and done a hundred things you had uptrend of.

49:25.900 --> 49:29.900
Wealed and sword and swung high on the sun at heavens.

49:29.900 --> 49:33.900
Covering there, I chased the feeding clouds along

49:33.900 --> 49:37.900
and flung my eaglett through footless halls of air.

49:37.900 --> 49:41.900
Up, up the high devious burning blue.

49:41.900 --> 49:44.900
I've topped the snow-clad heights with easy grease,

49:44.900 --> 49:47.900
wherever log or even eagle flew.

49:47.900 --> 49:53.900
And while the silent lifting mind, I've drawn the high untrusted sanctities of space

49:53.900 --> 49:57.900
put out my hand and touched the face of God.

49:59.900 --> 50:03.900
Well, Gabber has the unique distinction of having lived through much of a century

50:03.900 --> 50:07.900
that saw great advancements in aeronautical technology.

50:07.900 --> 50:11.900
He has seen orbital right-fly during the earliest days of the airplane

50:11.900 --> 50:14.900
and he has seen Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.

50:14.900 --> 50:17.900
In the time separating those two legendary events,

50:17.900 --> 50:21.900
the United States has been steadily advancing the field of aeronautics.

50:21.900 --> 50:24.900
In 1958, we witnessed the birth of NASA.

50:24.900 --> 50:27.900
In the 1960s, NASA comes of age.

50:27.900 --> 50:31.900
However, before we concentrate on that period of time,

50:31.900 --> 50:35.900
we look at some of the developments in people responsible for the progress

50:35.900 --> 50:37.900
made in aircraft performance.

50:37.900 --> 50:41.900
This is the subject of next week's show, America's Wings.

50:41.900 --> 50:43.900
Till then, I'm Jim Burnett.

51:01.900 --> 51:03.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:03.900 --> 51:05.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:05.900 --> 51:07.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:07.900 --> 51:09.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:11.900 --> 51:13.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:13.900 --> 51:15.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:15.900 --> 51:17.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:17.900 --> 51:19.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:19.900 --> 51:21.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:21.900 --> 51:23.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:23.900 --> 51:25.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:25.900 --> 51:27.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:27.900 --> 51:29.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:29.900 --> 51:31.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:31.900 --> 51:33.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:33.900 --> 51:35.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:35.900 --> 51:37.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:37.900 --> 51:39.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:39.900 --> 51:41.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:41.900 --> 51:43.900
I'm Jim Burnett.

51:43.900 --> 51:45.900
I'm Jim Burnett.
