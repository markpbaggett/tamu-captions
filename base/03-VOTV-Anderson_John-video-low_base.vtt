00:30.000 --> 00:32.560
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.760
I'm Tom Terbiville.

00:34.760 --> 00:39.640
John Anderson is quick to tell you that his year-long service in Vietnam was not frontline

00:39.640 --> 00:41.760
duty, no direct combat.

00:41.760 --> 00:46.600
He even goes so far as to call his job an easy one, but after hearing his story, I really

00:46.600 --> 00:48.640
can't agree and I doubt if you will.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.880
John Anderson did not fly the gunships, but he flew above them.

00:51.880 --> 00:57.800
It is O1 Bird Dog Single Engineer Craft guiding them identifying landing zones and areas to

00:57.800 --> 00:58.800
attack.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.400
Nonetheless, John Anderson counts himself fortunate to have come home from Vietnam alive

01:03.400 --> 01:04.800
and you'll understand why.

01:04.800 --> 01:05.800
John, welcome.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.800
I do.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.640
I've been on this show for a long time.

01:07.640 --> 01:12.600
You have led me to a lot of veterans and finally I get you on the show.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.080
You served in Vietnam.

01:14.080 --> 01:21.720
You talk about that your job was not as combative as other jobs, but still you do catch yourself

01:21.720 --> 01:25.240
lucky to have come home from Vietnam because there were near misses in your service.

01:25.240 --> 01:26.240
Oh yes.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.040
It was very interesting.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.040
You talk about them.

01:29.040 --> 01:35.240
Well, to know what I went through, you'd have to know what I did and I flew that O1 Bird

01:35.240 --> 01:37.640
Dog was an observation plane, right?

01:37.640 --> 01:42.040
Suscena with a lot more power than the old O19.

01:42.040 --> 01:49.600
And my job was to work with either naval gunfire or artillery or infantry on occasion, but

01:49.600 --> 01:55.880
it evolved that my main job was I believe getting Americans out of trouble, working with

01:55.880 --> 02:00.760
a Charlie Company 75th Ranger is a lot in my last six months and working with a unit

02:00.760 --> 02:04.160
called the first of the 50th mechanized.

02:04.160 --> 02:11.880
And in doing that, I witnessed a lot of fascinating things, educational things as to what people

02:11.880 --> 02:16.520
are capable of doing when they're challenged.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.840
If you had an American in trouble, you had more help than you knew what to do with.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.560
Because everybody wanted to help out.

02:23.560 --> 02:29.040
In fact, talking about working with the Rangers and you talked about identifying landing zones,

02:29.040 --> 02:34.320
I watched a helicopter piloted by a man called Haas Cartwright.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.360
He had a big handlebar mustache.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.960
He was a big guy.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.120
His last name was Cartwright.

02:39.120 --> 02:43.120
Benanza was popular in those days, so we called him Haas.

02:43.120 --> 02:47.120
He flew a UH1 hotel or Delta model.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.200
I can't recall which.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.360
And we would load these Rangers onto the helicopters.

02:52.360 --> 02:57.800
We'd have some gunships or not, depending on what we were doing or where we were.

02:57.800 --> 03:03.640
And he would land or the helicopter pilot would land in a succession of landing zones.

03:03.640 --> 03:06.080
They were flying at treetop level.

03:06.080 --> 03:11.800
So I couldn't fly over them and give away their position and they couldn't see the landing

03:11.800 --> 03:12.960
zones.

03:12.960 --> 03:18.160
So I'd give them headings and count off the meters as they were approaching the landing zone.

03:18.160 --> 03:23.920
They would go into each one and at a pre-arranged landing zone, they would let the Rangers out.

03:23.920 --> 03:28.840
Well, the North Vietnamese for their part being fairly smart.

03:28.840 --> 03:33.520
Whenever they would come to a rest position, they would set up around the landing zone,

03:33.520 --> 03:36.280
just in case Americans happen to land there.

03:36.280 --> 03:39.760
So we've got triple canopy jungle and then these clearings.

03:39.760 --> 03:43.480
In one day, Haas put a team on the ground.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.760
He took off.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.560
The North Vietnamese would always wait until the helicopter took off.

03:48.560 --> 03:53.400
And they had put set up around this landing zone and they opened up on the six man team

03:53.400 --> 03:54.400
of Rangers.

03:54.400 --> 03:59.360
We call them long-range reconnaissance patrol or lurps.

03:59.360 --> 04:04.880
As that happened and his cart right was coming out of the LZ, he took a least one round

04:04.880 --> 04:08.080
through his main rotor blade, which set up a vibration that was pretty interesting

04:08.080 --> 04:09.080
to handle.

04:09.680 --> 04:15.440
And at that point, instead of flying away, he made that helicopter do something I have

04:15.440 --> 04:17.160
never seen before since.

04:17.160 --> 04:23.640
He did the tightest, steepest turn I've ever seen in a helicopter and he did it at low level

04:23.640 --> 04:29.400
right over those trees and came back into the landing zone and sat there on the ground

04:29.400 --> 04:31.600
until every one of those Rangers got on board.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.120
You can see tracers coming out of the treeline flying by these guys.

04:35.120 --> 04:40.480
You know that there's four rounds, four bullets for every tracer you see, but he sat on

04:40.480 --> 04:43.000
the ground until everybody got on board and then took off.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.840
And it's a single bravest thing I've ever witnessed.

04:45.840 --> 04:50.440
And that's just one of the fascinating stories that you came back from Vietnam with.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.200
A lot of them involved yourself.

04:52.200 --> 04:56.840
I want to go back a little bit, talk about your first joining the Army.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.880
You joined pretty much straight out of college.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.400
Went to Texas, Western.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.080
You were in school there when they won the NCAA basketball.

05:03.080 --> 05:06.120
It certainly was and so was Anne, but we didn't know each other at that time.

05:06.120 --> 05:08.480
My wife Anne was, we met later on.

05:08.480 --> 05:13.240
You married your wife and in 1966 you've been married nearly 39 years.

05:13.240 --> 05:17.840
She was an Army wife and she was home when you were serving in Vietnam.

05:17.840 --> 05:22.480
We didn't talk about this earlier, but that had to been very difficult for you and her.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.840
It was, any separation is difficult.

05:25.840 --> 05:30.920
Separation under those circumstances is extremely difficult and that's why I feel so for

05:30.920 --> 05:36.000
the troops that are serving now in Iraq and Afghanistan as I have in every conflict we've

05:36.000 --> 05:37.520
sent people to.

05:37.520 --> 05:43.680
I also left a nine-month-old son and he was 21 months when I got back and that was a

05:43.680 --> 05:44.680
tough thing to do.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.880
Fortunately, you came home to a 21-month-old son.

05:47.880 --> 05:48.880
That's good.

05:48.880 --> 05:49.880
You're training in Georgia.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.720
Went to Fort Rucker, went to Fort Stewart.

05:51.720 --> 05:52.720
You learned how to fly.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.720
I learned how to fly.

05:53.720 --> 05:58.600
Initially, a fixed-wing training, initial entry fixed-wing and at Fort Stewart, Georgia,

05:58.600 --> 06:04.720
for four months and then to Fort Rucker for four months and came out with a single engine

06:04.720 --> 06:10.280
land, multi-engine instrument rated and was glad to have it.

06:10.280 --> 06:17.400
You had some experiences before you ever got to Vietnam that nearly never got you to Vietnam.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.000
Talk about some of your early flying experiences.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.520
I was technically, I guess you could call them crashes, but I was in two incidents.

06:24.520 --> 06:31.400
I was in an ROTC flight training in school where my lack of experience helped me to run

06:31.400 --> 06:36.000
off the runway into some sand and stand the plane up on its nose.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.600
The other one was in flight school, flying with my, what you call, stick buddy, Bobby

06:40.600 --> 06:44.720
Beale, who in fact tried to kill me three times.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.440
But this day, he was doing a really bad landing.

06:48.440 --> 06:53.240
It was a beautiful spring day and I had my elbow on the windowsill of the plane, the back

06:53.240 --> 06:58.160
seat because it's a pilot sits in the front and observer in the back and he rounded out

06:58.160 --> 07:04.000
about ten feet too high and fell in and bounced and then the engine caught and instead of

07:04.000 --> 07:08.200
going around, he closed the throttle again and bounced again up even higher and finally

07:08.200 --> 07:11.320
the third time he was about 30 feet in the air.

07:11.320 --> 07:15.360
When he came down, I looked at the left wing tip and I thought, well, that's awfully close

07:15.360 --> 07:19.040
to the ground and this is a really bad landing.

07:19.040 --> 07:24.200
He got it straightened out, heading on the ground, broke ground like he was going to take

07:24.200 --> 07:30.920
off finally, heading for a tree line of 60 foot pine trees and as I looked over his shoulder,

07:30.920 --> 07:35.280
I noticed that we weren't climbing and the trees were coming up fast and I looked out

07:35.280 --> 07:40.160
of the corner of my eye and here were 60 degrees of flaps on that bird dog, retarding our

07:40.160 --> 07:41.520
climb.

07:41.520 --> 07:45.600
So I said, Bob, bring up your flaps, not all of them, just half and I watched to make sure

07:45.640 --> 07:54.000
we stopped at the takeoff setting and we went around and Bob said, John, I'm terrified.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.680
And I said, well, Bob, would you like me to land this from the back seat?

07:57.680 --> 08:00.880
And he thought a moment and said, I'm not that terrified.

08:00.880 --> 08:06.440
So it came in and landed and I found out after we landed that we had put the wingtip

08:06.440 --> 08:12.080
a foot into the ground, should a cartwheeled but it cut cleanly through the ground and

08:12.080 --> 08:15.520
said until we got to the tree line, people on the ground could see trees above our

08:15.520 --> 08:16.520
aircraft.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.960
And that's when the flaps came up and we cleared the trees.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.920
You must have thought Vietnam's going to be a breeze.

08:20.920 --> 08:21.920
Sure.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.760
Maybe if you could go through this.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.560
You went jungle training and the Philippines before you went to Vietnam.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.960
I'll talk about what was involved.

08:27.960 --> 08:32.640
Yeah, that was jungle survival school and they taught us what we could eat and what

08:32.640 --> 08:39.080
we couldn't and taught us how to trap water to drink and we made our own hammocks out

08:39.080 --> 08:43.000
of parachutes and heard all this noise.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.120
We thought it was people walking around at night and the jungle turned out its rats and

08:47.120 --> 08:48.280
the jungle is full of rats.

08:48.280 --> 08:52.280
So it's not a vacation spot necessarily.

08:52.280 --> 08:57.440
But they had people looking for us and you had to try and keep from getting caught.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.760
And it was an interesting training.

08:59.760 --> 09:03.560
I think it prepared us pretty well in case anything happened in country.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.560
And then you went in country?

09:05.560 --> 09:07.360
Where exactly did you go initially?

09:07.360 --> 09:08.360
Were you stationed?

09:08.440 --> 09:09.760
They have an interesting process.

09:09.760 --> 09:17.520
You go into the Long Bend replacement depot and I got assigned to the first aviation brigade

09:17.520 --> 09:22.520
which assigned me to the 17th group in the Triangue which assigned me the 223rd battalion

09:22.520 --> 09:28.840
in Quingyan which assigned me to the 183rd Reconnaissance Aviation Company at Fantheet

09:28.840 --> 09:33.640
or actually at Dong Patin across the Bay from Camelon which assigned me to the second flight

09:33.640 --> 09:36.680
of the tune at Fantheet.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.040
And Fantheet is on the coast.

09:39.040 --> 09:43.520
It's a coastal plane about 20 miles deep and then mountains that range upwards of a little

09:43.520 --> 09:48.080
over 5,000 feet and triple canopy jungle in the valley.

09:48.080 --> 09:55.920
And the mom capital of the world, it's a Vietnamese sauce made from very deceased fish.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.960
And it smells really bad when it's being made but it's good to eat.

09:59.960 --> 10:00.960
It tastes better than it smells.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.560
It's certainly about a minute.

10:03.560 --> 10:10.000
Talk a little bit more specifically about what your job was and the bird dog so people

10:10.000 --> 10:16.200
really understand exactly what your mission was and how you helped out other pilots.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.520
But primarily it was reconnaissance.

10:18.520 --> 10:25.480
That was the number one job looking for the enemy wherever we were assigned to look.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.840
I did a lot of naval gunfire support.

10:27.840 --> 10:31.640
I'd fly a Marine or Navy person in the back seat.

10:31.640 --> 10:35.880
We'd adjust the ships gunfire where they could reach inland.

10:35.880 --> 10:40.520
I worked with the artillery batteries to help them register and then I would fire artillery

10:40.520 --> 10:45.760
when there was an event that called for attacking the enemy with artillery.

10:45.760 --> 10:49.600
I worked with, like I said, the first of 50th mechanized.

10:49.600 --> 10:53.400
My job, since they make a lot of noise and aren't going to surprise anybody, was to fire

10:53.400 --> 10:58.640
artillery in front of them and set off any mines that might be there.

10:58.640 --> 11:02.760
You'd get secondary explosions after your artillery round went off and that would indicate

11:02.760 --> 11:04.520
that there were mines in there.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.360
I got used to working with them a lot.

11:07.360 --> 11:11.920
The most interesting job really was the Rangers, the 75th Rangers.

11:11.920 --> 11:17.480
That led to a lot of interesting events because their job was to go out into that mountainous

11:17.480 --> 11:24.680
area into the triple canopy, 300 foot tall tree jungle and find North Vietnamese.

11:24.680 --> 11:30.320
Our job was to help them go in, to help them when they were there in case they lost communications

11:30.320 --> 11:37.400
or gotten trouble, got jumped by a larger force which happened all too often and then to

11:37.400 --> 11:39.800
help them get out.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.200
I would either use gunships to help get them out.

11:43.200 --> 11:50.680
If they were in contact or I had one occasion in particular, I was called on to fire artillery

11:50.680 --> 11:58.080
and we had moved to battery on top of a mountain and of 105 millimeter artillery.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.320
This six man lurptime was running from North Vietnamese.

12:01.320 --> 12:07.720
They'd gotten outnumbered and were being chased running full tilt through the jungle.

12:07.720 --> 12:13.040
My job was to call artillery on the Vietnamese, on the North Vietnamese, but I couldn't

12:13.040 --> 12:14.040
see anybody.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.040
I couldn't see the Americans.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.080
I couldn't see the Vietnamese.

12:17.080 --> 12:23.160
I would call the artillery between the North Vietnamese and the Americans and I would

12:23.160 --> 12:27.960
figure that it was between because the lurps would tell me by the shrapnel coming to

12:27.960 --> 12:32.560
the trees if I was getting too close to them.

12:32.560 --> 12:36.560
It was a situation when you're firing artillery close to US troops.

12:36.560 --> 12:40.640
It can scare you.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.840
Most frightened I've ever been was when I used the wrong gun target line and thought I'd

12:44.840 --> 12:49.400
landed too close as some troops with an eight inch gun.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.120
That'll ruin your whole day.

12:51.120 --> 12:57.280
In this case, because you know you're firing close to Americans, you first give the command

12:57.280 --> 13:01.880
to the artillery battery danger and then when it's really close you say danger close and

13:01.880 --> 13:06.000
that's the way it was this whole time until they got to an LZ and got picked up.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.040
That I count as a singular event helping those guys get out of trouble.

13:11.040 --> 13:16.400
You flew your aircraft not directly over the targets so it's not give away the location

13:16.400 --> 13:20.120
and you also flew about a thousand feet above the trees mostly.

13:20.120 --> 13:24.880
You were essentially out of harm's way because you were too far up for the enemy to normally

13:24.880 --> 13:26.520
just shoot at you normally.

13:26.520 --> 13:30.480
But sometimes you did get down there I guess because of cloud cover.

13:30.480 --> 13:36.840
Well cloud cover or if we were looking for something in particular, sometimes you can't

13:37.160 --> 13:40.800
see from above what you're looking for.

13:40.800 --> 13:45.480
I could tell from a thousand feet for example after a while you become trained to where

13:45.480 --> 13:50.080
you can pick things out your eyes get better and I could tell from a thousand feet up if

13:50.080 --> 13:57.200
the trail had been used in the last little while just by the difference in color.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.400
And then we could drop down.

13:58.400 --> 14:04.080
Now understand, again I told you this before, there's a difference between courage and

14:04.080 --> 14:05.080
confidence.

14:05.320 --> 14:09.760
I didn't have a lot of courage but I developed a lot of confidence and you might call it

14:09.760 --> 14:11.960
being young and stupid too.

14:11.960 --> 14:19.640
But I could drop my flaps and fly that plane very slowly and we would fly over a trail

14:19.640 --> 14:22.320
where we'd seen that somebody had been there.

14:22.320 --> 14:27.640
One particular case in American had been killed by a sniper and we were looking for the

14:27.640 --> 14:32.280
guy and we followed this trail by the back cedar looking to see which direction the footprints

14:32.280 --> 14:33.280
went.

14:33.280 --> 14:38.320
And so you had to get down pretty low to do that but again I didn't as long as I was

14:38.320 --> 14:41.120
inside my airplane I didn't feel threatened.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.120
So it didn't matter how low or how high it was.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.440
And that's where the confidence came in.

14:46.440 --> 14:50.760
You brought some pictures with you and I want to go to some of those we're going to close

14:50.760 --> 14:54.520
in on some of the pictures to sort of give people an idea.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.200
First off you can look right there at that monitor right over there and you can see the

14:57.200 --> 15:01.320
first picture what that is you and what are we looking at.

15:01.320 --> 15:04.440
I'm in training there at Fort Rucker Alabama.

15:04.440 --> 15:09.760
I'm by that time I believe I'm a first lieutenant and that may have even been the day where

15:09.760 --> 15:15.360
the wives came out to watch us land and take off over a string barrier with penance hanging

15:15.360 --> 15:16.680
down.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.360
So that was the...

15:18.360 --> 15:21.400
And that is the bird dog that's what you were right there.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.400
That's what you were trained to fly the last part of your training and the truth.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.080
You were the entire tour of Vietnam.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.080
That's correct.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.080
Okay.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.080
I'm going to go to another picture.

15:30.360 --> 15:37.080
That's the ocean in the background and that's the one end of the runway is right below

15:37.080 --> 15:42.640
that picture and that hanger is our hanger and the building you see to the left was where

15:42.640 --> 15:45.240
I lived the first six months I was there.

15:45.240 --> 15:53.440
It's an old French post and we had running water, no heat but running water.

15:53.440 --> 15:58.040
So I took a lot of cold showers and those are revetments made out of 55 gallon oil drums

15:58.040 --> 16:00.840
that we parked the aircraft in that are surrounding the hanger.

16:00.840 --> 16:06.520
In fact there is an aircraft there in that one revetment is an Air 4-0-2.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.520
How was all of this built?

16:08.520 --> 16:09.520
How?

16:09.520 --> 16:10.520
Yeah.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.520
Most of that was built by the French.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.520
That was built by the French.

16:13.520 --> 16:14.520
Okay.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.520
And you see that red cross there that's the dust off pad.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.520
Right.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.120
Because after I left there they moved an aid station into that building and that's where

16:22.120 --> 16:24.120
we would take wounded.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.120
Okay.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.620
What are we looking at here?

16:26.620 --> 16:31.780
That's a typical fire base I believe that was a 105 battery of artillery, usually six

16:31.780 --> 16:36.980
tubes of 105 millimeter artillery.

16:36.980 --> 16:40.620
And that's out in the middle of that coastal plain somewhere.

16:40.620 --> 16:41.740
I don't know which one that was.

16:41.740 --> 16:46.460
We had about three 105 batteries and one battery that was a combination of eight inch and

16:46.460 --> 16:47.460
one seven five.

16:47.460 --> 16:49.460
And you took this picture from here?

16:49.460 --> 16:50.460
Yes.

16:50.460 --> 16:55.740
Christmas time.

16:55.740 --> 17:03.860
Here's a Christmas in Vietnam and we had a little beach party and the man on the right

17:03.860 --> 17:05.340
was the platoon leader at the time.

17:05.340 --> 17:09.340
He was a captain Billy J.C., S.E.A.Y.

17:09.340 --> 17:13.460
And he had been an NCO with the first infantry division his first tour.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.780
So this was his second exposure of Vietnam.

17:15.780 --> 17:21.620
And that's me sitting on the little boat looking a lot thinner than I looked today.

17:21.620 --> 17:23.860
Not that much.

17:23.860 --> 17:27.020
But that was Christmas away from home.

17:27.020 --> 17:29.580
So you tried to get as many smiles as you could.

17:29.580 --> 17:32.100
We smile a lot.

17:32.100 --> 17:35.580
People can do that even under difficult circumstances.

17:35.580 --> 17:41.420
They can make light humor and good times release the stress.

17:41.420 --> 17:42.420
Final picture.

17:42.420 --> 17:46.740
This is a picture that we think that someone else took and that that indeed could be you.

17:46.740 --> 17:47.740
It's been a long time.

17:47.740 --> 17:49.260
It's been a long time.

17:49.260 --> 17:52.020
That's what the bird dog looked like flying.

17:52.020 --> 17:53.020
That's right.

17:53.500 --> 17:58.540
The reason we think that that's my bird dog in the background is because that's not my

17:58.540 --> 18:00.780
camera that took that picture.

18:00.780 --> 18:06.620
And somebody would have given that to me to take home.

18:06.620 --> 18:12.580
In the right side of that picture you see the back end of a rocket tube.

18:12.580 --> 18:18.740
My bird dogs were armed with four 2.75 inch bite phosphorus rockets.

18:18.740 --> 18:21.100
And we use them for marking the targets.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.300
Two under each wing.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.620
Fascinating pictures.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.940
Thank you for bringing those.

18:26.940 --> 18:31.020
You talked about I think the first time you went up in Vietnam I believe you got shot at.

18:31.020 --> 18:32.020
Oh yeah.

18:32.020 --> 18:34.620
And you weren't really sure that you were what exactly it was.

18:34.620 --> 18:35.620
Tell that story.

18:35.620 --> 18:37.940
Well it was a first flight in our province.

18:37.940 --> 18:40.940
And a Marine first lieutenant who was an ancient guy.

18:40.940 --> 18:42.660
He was all of 30 years old.

18:42.660 --> 18:44.980
So we thought he was really old.

18:44.980 --> 18:48.780
He took me out into the area to fire a nibble gunfire.

18:48.780 --> 18:52.260
And on the way out he said I think there's a guy in this big bush down there.

18:52.260 --> 18:56.700
And the bush was about 30 feet across and 30 feet tall.

18:56.700 --> 19:01.220
So being the fresh out of flight school guy was I knew how to bring the plane down and

19:01.220 --> 19:03.020
fly around the bush.

19:03.020 --> 19:06.940
And sure enough I saw the guy and I heard this noise and I recognized the noise.

19:06.940 --> 19:09.620
It was a clattering sound.

19:09.620 --> 19:12.380
And I went around the bush and it stopped and as I came back around the side where the

19:12.380 --> 19:15.420
guy was I heard the noise again and I thought what's wrong with my airplane.

19:15.420 --> 19:18.980
I looked at the gauges and couldn't see anything wrong.

19:18.980 --> 19:24.380
Coming back around one more time and I thought when I heard that noise again I thought Larry

19:24.380 --> 19:27.380
Doke is pulling a trick on a rookie.

19:27.380 --> 19:29.980
This is something they do to all the new guys.

19:29.980 --> 19:34.220
And I turned around and looked at him in the back seat and I said what is that noise.

19:34.220 --> 19:38.220
And he was sitting there with his feet on the floor in his hands in his lap calmly looking

19:38.220 --> 19:43.100
out the window and we were probably about 50 feet above the ground.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.700
And he said you idiot we're getting shot at.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.540
And that was an AK-47 shooting that is.

19:47.540 --> 19:48.540
And that's what it sounded like.

19:48.540 --> 19:49.540
That's what it sounded like.

19:49.540 --> 19:52.100
First time you'd heard it, first time I'd heard it, but you probably didn't forget it.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.100
I remembered.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.100
I can still hear it.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.700
You can still hear it.

19:55.700 --> 20:02.300
One of the fascinating stories that you told me was about a mission that ended up a lot

20:02.300 --> 20:03.300
better than it could have.

20:03.300 --> 20:06.700
And you know which one I'm talking about where you had to do a little wrestling with a

20:06.700 --> 20:09.300
parachute and a flare.

20:09.300 --> 20:12.540
Talk about how that developed and how it came out.

20:12.540 --> 20:18.100
So one night, I did a lot of night flying and I enjoyed flying at night.

20:18.100 --> 20:26.260
I was the alert pilot and I was called out to help place where either a Vietnamese National

20:26.260 --> 20:32.780
Guard or Arvin Army of Vietnam compound had been hit and taken some casualties.

20:32.780 --> 20:37.660
And we were trying to get the North Vietnamese that had hit them.

20:37.660 --> 20:45.020
We had an Air Force gunship, C-119 gunship with a 20-millimeter Vulcan Gatling gun.

20:45.020 --> 20:50.620
And they were flying about 4,500 feet and flying north of the highway.

20:50.620 --> 20:52.220
And I was flying south of the highway.

20:52.220 --> 20:54.420
We did racetrack patterns.

20:54.420 --> 20:58.020
And they were kicking out flares and even with the flares they couldn't see the ground,

20:58.020 --> 20:59.540
but I could.

20:59.540 --> 21:06.020
And I could actually adjust their fire by telling them how far off the target they were and

21:06.020 --> 21:09.540
the target was screen beds and we figured the enemy would use the screen beds to hide

21:09.540 --> 21:14.740
their movement as they went back north to the mountains to escape.

21:14.740 --> 21:21.100
Well I didn't realize it but they had kicked out an extra flare south of the highway so

21:21.100 --> 21:26.620
that a dust off helicopter could go in and pick up the wounded.

21:26.620 --> 21:30.540
And of course these things were burning out above my altitude.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.060
And I remember looking out to the right.

21:32.060 --> 21:38.580
I was flying west at the time, looking out to the right and looking in front of me just

21:38.580 --> 21:41.780
in time to see a white blur in front of my nose.

21:41.780 --> 21:44.500
And it's one of those things where it's instant recognition.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.100
You don't have to think the words.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.980
You just know what it is.

21:47.980 --> 21:52.220
And I hit right rudder and right aileron as hard as I could to try to turn away.

21:52.220 --> 21:56.860
And not being the bravest guy in the world, I actually flinched and I sort of close my

21:56.860 --> 21:59.740
eyes and turn my head to the right.

21:59.740 --> 22:06.300
And the next thing I knew I heard this loud wham and the plane snapped to the left and

22:06.300 --> 22:08.260
I thought I had lost a wing.

22:08.260 --> 22:12.740
But I kept the right rudder in and I got it straightened out and I looked up and the

22:12.740 --> 22:17.300
wham was this canister that hangs down that is coated with chemicals that burns and that's

22:17.300 --> 22:18.300
the flare.

22:18.300 --> 22:22.140
And it's suspended from a 16 foot diameter canopy parachute.

22:22.140 --> 22:26.780
And the canister had hit the underside of the wing and left about a three inch dent.

22:26.780 --> 22:30.740
And the parachute deployed over the top of the wing with its shroud lines wrapped around

22:30.740 --> 22:34.700
my rocket tubes and it acted like a big air break.

22:34.700 --> 22:38.780
So at that point it slowed me down to about 70 knots which is a little more than 70 miles

22:38.780 --> 22:40.660
an hour.

22:40.660 --> 22:45.100
And I had the plane going straight but I could only make left turns.

22:45.100 --> 22:51.300
And the winds were very strong and I told the Air Force pilot that I couldn't play anymore

22:51.300 --> 22:55.780
and I was going back to the base which is about 20 minutes away.

22:55.780 --> 23:01.140
And so I did a left turn back to the base and I was maybe five minutes into the flight

23:01.140 --> 23:05.660
back and I remembered that I had a Vietnamese observer in the back seat.

23:05.660 --> 23:09.900
I'd been sort of busy and had unfortunately forgotten about him.

23:09.900 --> 23:15.620
So I keed the mic and turned and smiled at him real big and said pretty exciting, huh?

23:15.620 --> 23:21.260
And this guy was the littlest observer we had, the littlest Vietnamese I ever knew.

23:21.260 --> 23:25.060
He had ripped this baby fire extinguisher out of a metal clamp on the back of my seat.

23:25.060 --> 23:28.340
He hadn't opened the clamp we found out later he ripped it out.

23:28.340 --> 23:31.740
He was holding it as if that would put out the fire because what happened was dragging

23:31.740 --> 23:36.100
that thing through the air was like blowing on the embers of a campfire and it burst into

23:36.100 --> 23:37.100
flame.

23:37.100 --> 23:40.660
And it was giving off enough light that I could read the lettering on my white phosphorus

23:40.660 --> 23:45.980
rockets and I could see my fuel vent dripping fuel and I can still see it today.

23:45.980 --> 23:52.180
And this young man was so scared that you've heard the expression trembling like a leaf,

23:52.180 --> 23:56.580
his entire body from his head to his boots and I looked was vibrating.

23:56.580 --> 23:58.260
He was so scared.

23:58.260 --> 24:03.660
And the string from that puny little fire extinguisher wasn't going to get to the flare.

24:03.660 --> 24:07.780
But eventually it went out of his own accord and I did a left turn onto final.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.380
I felt I had the land into the wind.

24:10.380 --> 24:16.260
Unfortunately into the wind meant I landed over the face of a cliff that this airfield was

24:16.260 --> 24:19.620
built on the edge of a 200 foot cliff.

24:19.620 --> 24:24.740
And in getting on final starting my descent I had never landed in that much wind with

24:24.740 --> 24:29.300
a parachute hanging over my wing before so I didn't know how to judge it.

24:29.300 --> 24:32.900
And my rate of descent was carrying me into the face of the cliff.

24:32.900 --> 24:37.740
And I added full power and was still coming down into the face of the cliff.

24:37.740 --> 24:44.860
And the only other choice was to turn off into the ocean at night, dark night, landing

24:44.860 --> 24:50.220
away from shore with no flotation gear, with a survival vest, full of radios and first

24:50.220 --> 24:58.420
aid kits and water and two bandaliers of M16 magazines around my chest like Punch O'Villia.

24:58.420 --> 25:01.140
And a Vietnamese in the back seat that I'm responsible for to get out.

25:01.140 --> 25:04.580
I figured we'd have to walk along the bottom because there's no way we could swim with

25:04.580 --> 25:06.740
the combat boots and all that.

25:06.740 --> 25:11.220
So I elected to stay on course as long as I could and only turn off and ruin the plane

25:11.220 --> 25:14.780
in the water if that was the last choice.

25:14.780 --> 25:23.460
And whether you ascribe it to the power finally starting to lift me up or the parachute ripping

25:23.460 --> 25:27.660
or God lifting up and giving me a little mercy.

25:27.660 --> 25:32.340
I remember clearing the face of the cliff close enough that I could look down and see the

25:32.340 --> 25:36.700
tango foot barbed wire and a bunker to my left and clear the road that ran right there

25:36.700 --> 25:39.340
and landed on the overrun of the runway.

25:39.340 --> 25:45.780
And there's a picture of my crew chiefs giving me a plaque with a piece of the parachute

25:45.780 --> 25:48.940
on it and a picture of me holding the parachute by the plane.

25:48.940 --> 25:52.380
So it was an interesting night.

25:52.380 --> 25:53.380
Interesting night.

25:53.380 --> 25:54.380
They ended up good.

25:54.380 --> 25:56.380
There were good nights and there were bad nights.

25:56.380 --> 25:59.940
Unfortunately, we only have about a minute left.

25:59.940 --> 26:03.820
You talked about a reflection that you had when you left Vietnam that changed 20 years

26:03.820 --> 26:04.820
later.

26:04.820 --> 26:05.660
I need you to be real quick.

26:05.660 --> 26:07.820
But tell me that again.

26:07.820 --> 26:14.020
Well knowing what I know today about our effort in Vietnam, I would do it again.

26:14.020 --> 26:19.980
I would absolutely do it again because I felt what I did was important.

26:19.980 --> 26:26.580
But for years I regretted not having killed more North Vietnamese, more communists.

26:26.580 --> 26:30.180
Now however, I regret having had to kill anybody.

26:30.180 --> 26:31.180
I'd still do it.

26:31.180 --> 26:33.380
I'd still go there and do my job.

26:33.380 --> 26:36.820
But I realized that most of those people were forced to be there.

26:36.820 --> 26:41.300
They had families and I regret having to kill anybody.

26:41.300 --> 26:47.180
And I think that's the way we ought to look at war is that you don't relish it.

26:47.180 --> 26:50.380
You don't relish hurting people.

26:50.380 --> 26:53.140
But sometimes you've got to do it.

26:53.140 --> 26:55.740
John Anderson, thank you for your service and thank you for being here.

26:55.740 --> 26:56.740
Wish we had more time.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.260
It's a wonderful story.

26:59.260 --> 27:04.180
Like so many brave soldiers of Vietnam, John Anderson indeed found himself in harm's

27:04.180 --> 27:05.180
way.

27:05.180 --> 27:10.900
And as he himself has said, he did his job not without fear, but indeed with confidence

27:10.900 --> 27:13.100
in his training and his ability.

27:13.100 --> 27:17.660
Like all veterans of that conflict, it's sometimes a difficult story to tell and it

27:17.660 --> 27:18.660
always should be.

27:18.660 --> 27:23.340
It's the same kind of stories we hear today from the war on terror.

27:23.340 --> 27:27.820
Also difficult to tell, but we must all listen with uncommon pride.

27:27.820 --> 27:33.860
We salute Brazos Valley, veteran, Major John Anderson and thank him and all veterans

27:33.860 --> 27:35.380
for their service.

27:35.380 --> 27:37.820
And thank you to our underwriter, First National Bank.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.060
I'm Tom Turbaville.

27:39.060 --> 27:43.740
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

27:43.740 --> 27:45.740
All right.

27:45.740 --> 27:47.740
We did it.

27:47.740 --> 27:50.740
Thank you very much.
