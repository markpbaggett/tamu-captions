00:30.000 --> 00:38.800
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley. I'm Tom Turbivill. Gary Banta has lived in

00:38.800 --> 00:44.480
the Brasis Valley since 1982. He was born in Brownfield, Texas, grew up in Kansas, and

00:44.480 --> 00:49.880
after high school and working for a time, he joined the Army in 1967. That was well into

00:49.880 --> 00:55.840
the Vietnam War. That's where he both drove and rode shotgun on truck con voice, delivering

00:55.840 --> 01:00.800
supplies to the hot spots where choppers and aircraft could not land. Yes, it was a

01:00.800 --> 01:05.720
year or two or it was quite dangerous, but he survived it without any serious wounds. He

01:05.720 --> 01:10.680
will talk to us about his time in Vietnam. And then later his duty at Fort Knox, where

01:10.680 --> 01:16.880
he indeed saw the gold. And later as a chaplain's assistant in Germany. And he's here to talk

01:16.880 --> 01:22.960
proudly about the work of the American Legion, Earl Graham post 159 of which he is now

01:22.960 --> 01:28.280
the commander. Please welcome Gary Banta to Veterans of the Valley. Gary, it is pleasure

01:28.280 --> 01:32.640
to have you here and thank you for your service. And especially to the American Legion, which

01:32.640 --> 01:37.200
we're going to talk about a lot here in a little bit. But let's talk about sort of you,

01:37.200 --> 01:41.720
you were born in Texas, you grew up in Kansas, and it won long after high school after working

01:41.720 --> 01:46.280
for a while that you decided to join the Army. Sort of talk about that transition from

01:46.280 --> 01:53.140
boyhood into the Army. Well, I grew up in cold water, Kansas, and after high school

01:53.140 --> 02:00.200
moved back to Texas and went to work on road job at Lake Meredith, that post-aborder.

02:00.200 --> 02:07.120
And it was awfully cold, so in Vietnam war was on and at that time it had not become

02:07.120 --> 02:13.640
unpopular. So I felt like I wanted to go in the military and so I joined and was sent

02:13.640 --> 02:17.760
to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri for basic training and then on to other duties.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.440
Yeah, you told me you, I guess you joined up in Amarillo and well most of the people were

02:21.440 --> 02:25.240
sent to Fort Bliss where it was warm. You couldn't get out of the cold, right? You were

02:25.240 --> 02:29.160
sent to Missouri. I've been working in ice and cold and up there in Amarillo and thought

02:29.160 --> 02:33.520
I'd try to go to Bliss to get basic and they sent me to Fort Leonard Wood.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.920
Having a vehicle operator, that's what you were trained in, but you never really did that

02:36.920 --> 02:41.160
until you got to Vietnam. And let's go ahead and talk about that because we've got a lot

02:41.160 --> 02:46.800
to talk about today. April 1st, April Fool's Day of 1968 was the day that you went in

02:46.800 --> 02:53.520
country. Talk about your first tour of duty in Vietnam and being on a convoy and sort

02:53.520 --> 02:55.320
of what all that involved.

02:55.320 --> 03:04.600
Okay, I landed at Cameron Bay, it was a reception center for income and people coming to

03:04.600 --> 03:10.080
Vietnam and there were a number of them but that's where I went and I stayed there for

03:10.080 --> 03:14.600
a day or two until I found out what unit I would be going to and then went to the

03:14.600 --> 03:16.600
name.

03:16.600 --> 03:21.800
And it was a sign for a short period of time with an organics company and what I wasn't

03:21.800 --> 03:28.000
there but just a few weeks and then on up across up into the northern part of Vietnam

03:28.000 --> 03:36.400
in the I-Core with the 1st Air Cavalry Division, 101st Airborne, Missouri, 25th Army Cavalry.

03:37.400 --> 03:45.440
This is in Fubai, northern part of Vietnam. Fubai is a southern suburb of Hawaii, the

03:45.440 --> 03:50.160
Citadel city and that battle had been going on and was just ending when I got there.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.160
Right.

03:51.160 --> 03:55.480
And for the rest of your duty, you ran convoy's. That was your job. But once you talk about

03:55.480 --> 04:01.440
that a little bit more specifically, talk about what that involved. You drove some but

04:01.440 --> 04:08.440
mostly you would ride shotgun with an M60. And so talk about the need for convoy's,

04:08.440 --> 04:13.640
talk about the effect of convoy's, what it did and this brought on pretty dicey situations

04:13.640 --> 04:14.640
for us.

04:14.640 --> 04:21.440
Sure did. A convoy's, the supply depot was at a place called Tan Mai. It was a deep water

04:21.440 --> 04:26.640
pier at the mouth of the Perfume River. The Perfume River runs through Hawaii but at the

04:26.640 --> 04:32.200
mouth of that river is a deep water pier. And everything that came into Vietnam came

04:32.200 --> 04:36.320
in through that deep water pier. All the supplies. All kinds of supplies. Every kind of thing

04:36.320 --> 04:41.480
you could imagine all the way from bullets to biscuits, you know, whatever came in came

04:41.480 --> 04:48.120
in there. And I would say the majority of the time we were hauling just the everyday

04:48.120 --> 04:55.120
things of life, right, trying to provide even plywood and things like that. But during

04:55.200 --> 05:01.720
the times when it got really serious, we were hauling ammunition, powder, rockets, every

05:01.720 --> 05:07.560
kind of thing you can imagine in support of these fire bases, right. And that's where

05:07.560 --> 05:12.240
the bad part of my exercise, not that that was all of it because we got murdered in

05:12.240 --> 05:17.520
early every night or rockets or something every night. But those convoy's where we would

05:17.520 --> 05:23.080
go out to that Tan Mai and pick up those loads of ammunition or whatever we were taken

05:23.080 --> 05:29.320
in land. And those were usually night-con boys running night. And I don't know if you know

05:29.320 --> 05:34.560
how that works, but there are no lights. All you have is on the rear of the vehicle in

05:34.560 --> 05:39.960
front of you are two triangles about the size of a dime. And when they light up red that

05:39.960 --> 05:45.200
breaks you're on when they're white, he's running. And that's all you've got to look at.

05:45.200 --> 05:50.280
And it's terrifying because in the middle of that, you're going to get shot at. Right.

05:50.280 --> 05:54.960
What's going to happen? And the thing that you most feared is being stopped. Stop.

05:54.960 --> 06:00.280
Because the VC would stop you by any means necessary whether it would be roadside mine

06:00.280 --> 06:06.400
or our grenade launcher or a truck or whatever. RPGs. And that happened. It did. It did

06:06.400 --> 06:12.000
happen. It did happen. And generally you would dismount and take you, mm-60 off the truck,

06:12.000 --> 06:18.440
the driver and the gunner get underneath the engine block of the truck. And we did that

06:18.440 --> 06:24.160
several times. Right. And prepared to defend the position. Yeah. I guess probably not

06:24.160 --> 06:28.360
much different than what goes on. But we didn't see any IEDs. Right. Wasn't any of that.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.560
Right. Now these were five and a half ton trucks, right? Five ton, five ton trucks. And

06:32.560 --> 06:37.640
we had in the con boys, especially those that were loaded with ammunition, we would have

06:37.640 --> 06:44.680
a five ton truck that had inch plate steel on it. And in the back of that was a quad 50.

06:44.680 --> 06:49.440
That's four 50 caliber machine guns electrically operated. There would be three of those in the

06:49.440 --> 06:54.680
con boy, then jeeps that moved all through the con boy with two M60s on them. So we had

06:54.680 --> 06:59.240
a lot of firepower. Right. But sometimes you needed it. Right. You know.

06:59.240 --> 07:04.120
August of 1968, you talked about one operation called Massachusetts Stryker. That's right.

07:04.120 --> 07:09.000
That was probably the, there were several weeks there that I, you know, I don't even really

07:09.000 --> 07:15.240
remember. It was such a blur because it was 24 hours a day. We never stopped. I mean,

07:15.240 --> 07:21.520
you'd sleep where you could sleep. But we would run to, out to the deep water peer, pick up

07:21.520 --> 07:27.400
ammunition powder. And that was so dangerous carrying that powder because one tracer into

07:27.400 --> 07:32.840
the truck load powder and that truck was gone. Right. And it did happen. It just didn't

07:32.840 --> 07:38.600
happen to me. But during Massachusetts Stryker, the enemy and the ash off valley were

07:39.080 --> 07:43.880
making a resurgence. And this is after case on and after the Tetefense of it in play, they

07:43.880 --> 07:49.880
were trying to recapture their stronghold of the ash off valley. Massachusetts Stryker was designed

07:49.880 --> 07:57.400
to beat them back. So we, we hauled ammunition to these fire bases, Birmingham, Bastone,

07:58.120 --> 08:05.480
Ande, Ronimo. And oftentimes they would fire the ammunition off the vehicles. I mean, they

08:05.480 --> 08:13.400
break the bands on 175, 155, how it's hers and fire it right off the trucks. And it was pretty

08:13.400 --> 08:20.040
spectacular. Right. And when you had to fire your, your weapon, that would light up and they'd

08:20.040 --> 08:22.840
know where you are. So you didn't want to pull the trigger. You wouldn't pull the trigger.

08:22.840 --> 08:28.200
M60 until you had to. Right. And once you did that, they definitely knew where you were.

08:28.200 --> 08:32.840
The differences are traces of red and there's a green. So you knew, you knew when they were coming,

08:32.840 --> 08:37.080
what you knew you were being shot at for sure. When you think about what you did and how often you

08:37.080 --> 08:43.320
ran these convoys and how you ran them and how often you did meet resistance, you were never

08:43.320 --> 08:48.280
wounded. You caught some shrapnel in the knee one time. Yeah, one time. And it was taken out, just

08:48.760 --> 08:53.560
made it, took it out. Made it took it out. Never reported. So no purple heart. But you have to feel

08:55.480 --> 09:01.400
very blessed and very fortunate that you came back without a wound. Yeah. I am. So many people didn't.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.600
I know many people that were hurt badly and they know some that were killed. And there are some

09:08.600 --> 09:15.000
that were killed that I don't know that were killed. So it was a bad time.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.720
I want to talk about the nature of this convoy again. You were telling me the other day that

09:20.520 --> 09:25.160
you were talking about route one and it runs the entire length of it all the way from the

09:25.160 --> 09:30.600
Mekong Delta to the DMZ. And eventually you quit running sort of convoy style because that's when

09:30.600 --> 09:35.960
you would get stopped and you'd run the trucks one at a time. And that would begin it way

09:36.520 --> 09:42.760
going north toward Dong Ha. Because the VC wouldn't waste their, when waste on the truck. They were

09:42.760 --> 09:47.560
less apt to try to stop one truck. Now they would shoot at you. Right. I mean you'd be driving on

09:47.560 --> 09:51.640
route one and you'd see the machine gun bullets striking the rice paddy coming towards you.

09:52.520 --> 09:57.880
And then they'd pass in front of you or hit your truck or you know but yeah, but you're just

09:57.880 --> 10:01.640
running wide open as fast as that truck would go. Yeah, that's what I wanted to talk about because

10:01.640 --> 10:06.760
sometimes these codboys would be up to 20 trucks. Yeah. Right. And it wouldn't be like a slow moving

10:06.760 --> 10:10.440
codboy. Now we'd be flying. You wouldn't catch the one in front of you and the one behind you

10:10.440 --> 10:14.840
wouldn't catch you. You'd be flying to get now from where you were from where you were to where you

10:14.840 --> 10:20.680
were going as fast as as fast as you could roll it. Yeah. And sometimes that meant having to deal with

10:20.680 --> 10:25.800
Vietnamese vehicles. They would have these buses loaded with ducks and geese and 300 people.

10:26.520 --> 10:31.480
And they get in and it was always very dicey because you didn't want them to stop and you were

10:31.480 --> 10:35.480
slowing you down. And if they tried to slow you down or it appeared they were trying to slow you

10:35.480 --> 10:41.320
down then it would make you think you know that they're trying to set me up and there was there's

10:41.320 --> 10:47.880
been more than one Lombard bus get pushed off road. Yeah. 70 miles an hour and I hope nobody got hurt

10:47.880 --> 10:51.880
but right. That's what they did and that's what I did. And these weren't paved highways. These were

10:51.880 --> 10:57.960
dirt roads. No. Route one was completely paved. Right. And if when you got off route one then you

10:57.960 --> 11:02.760
begin to worry about mines because before on route one they couldn't mind if asphalt had

11:02.760 --> 11:08.280
road and the areas when they would repair them in the mornings engineers would run minesweeps on

11:08.280 --> 11:13.080
that section while they were repairing the road so you'd be safe on route one as long as you're on

11:13.080 --> 11:18.200
that asphalt. So the asphalt valley was pretty it was it was pretty complete with mines. I mean

11:18.280 --> 11:23.480
there once you once you passed into the asphalt valley you were definitely an enemy territory. I

11:23.480 --> 11:29.160
asked you the other day were you afraid and tell me what your answer answer was you said you said

11:29.160 --> 11:35.000
you were you you you you were afraid but you weren't terrified. I was afraid but I was not terrified. I

11:35.000 --> 11:42.840
was young and you know I don't know I guess I had confidence that I'd been trained well enough to

11:42.840 --> 11:49.800
do what I was supposed to do that I just was not terrified I was afraid I mean when when mortars

11:49.800 --> 11:56.360
are falling around you a man would be a fool to say that he wasn't afraid yeah but I wasn't

11:56.360 --> 12:02.280
terrified nor was I ever not able to think clearly or right. We talked about one time about

12:03.800 --> 12:07.800
going to get some bread and the convoy took off without you yeah yeah that's all that story.

12:07.800 --> 12:15.240
That was foolish of them or you. Me of me it was really crazy thing I did they

12:15.240 --> 12:20.760
Vietnamese had these little carts and they made bread and we were in Hawaii waiting at a night

12:20.760 --> 12:27.000
convoy and and of course I was hungry I don't know if you ever tried to live on seagrassians but

12:27.000 --> 12:32.840
if you could get any kind of food real food so I saw this bread thing up the street and it was I

12:32.840 --> 12:38.840
don't know not more than a block and I had a Fritz was his name he was a new guy in country and

12:38.840 --> 12:43.000
he was he was driving the truck I said Fritz stay right here I'm gonna run up there and get some

12:43.000 --> 12:49.160
that bread and he said oh don't do that better than I said yeah I'm gonna go so I took off. Well

12:49.160 --> 12:55.080
I didn't get started good and I hear him take off I hear the truck's taken off so I ran to this

12:55.080 --> 13:00.840
style and I got the bread and gave him some NPC I don't know how much whatever I gave him and ran

13:00.840 --> 13:05.960
back well time I got back the trucks were going around the corner of maybe two or three block

13:05.960 --> 13:11.480
stands when I run the corner well you don't just and we had a heavy load so you don't just start off

13:11.480 --> 13:18.360
take off real fast so in a little bit we're flying and it's dark we can't see anything and you

13:18.360 --> 13:22.920
know we're trying to look for these white triangles it'll be in front of us right because no lights

13:22.920 --> 13:27.560
right we're flying this is fast if we can go and we pass the Catholic church I think you'll

13:27.560 --> 13:32.840
throw a picture of that Catholic church we passed that Catholic church and it's just shortly after

13:32.840 --> 13:38.040
you pass that as a bridge and the Vietnamese were protecting that bridge if you didn't guard the

13:38.040 --> 13:44.120
bridge as they just blow them up so they had they had bunkers all around that bridge and they had

13:44.120 --> 13:51.800
just pulled all the Constantine wire back across the road and we came around that corner and there's

13:51.800 --> 14:00.760
all that Constantine wire and we hit it at about 70 miles an hour and drug Constantine wire

14:00.760 --> 14:07.000
and it took me days to get all that wire out of the actual truck but we didn't stop you mentioned

14:07.000 --> 14:10.600
the picture so let's go ahead and go to some photographs right now as a matter of fact because

14:10.600 --> 14:16.040
we've got something to look at that from your collection the first picture is going to be of you

14:17.640 --> 14:21.720
just very soon after there it is right there this is a pretty soon after you arrived

14:21.720 --> 14:27.080
in country yeah I hadn't been there hadn't been there more than maybe a week or 10 days at most

14:27.080 --> 14:35.720
you see I've got an M14 and it was pretty strange to get an M14 but that's what I was issued

14:35.720 --> 14:42.680
but they shortly took those up and gave the same 16s this is an M60 yeah that's an M60 that's

14:42.680 --> 14:48.040
that's our perimeter at food by looking toward the South China Sea I don't know why I took that

14:48.040 --> 14:56.360
picture even if I did take that picture but at night time the direction that gun pointed was a

14:57.880 --> 15:04.600
fearful place because you didn't know what was out there okay actually the rifle patrol that's

15:04.600 --> 15:15.240
a Chinese shotgun bolt action 7.62 by 51 millimeter rifle with a bayonet it's not even a semi-automatic

15:15.240 --> 15:21.320
I don't know where I found it I have no idea but I found it had plans to bring it home but

15:21.320 --> 15:25.960
somebody got it or took it away from here maybe they I don't know what happened to it but you got

15:25.960 --> 15:30.600
a picture of it I got a picture of it there you go there you go talk about this picture it's

15:30.600 --> 15:35.800
pretty fascinating well you see a bridge there that's it I analyzed that's between quantery and

15:35.800 --> 15:43.720
way and they blown up that bridge the North Vietnamese blew it up and so they're reconstructing it

15:44.520 --> 15:52.520
the engineers are and the CBS and so our convoy would go into the river and drive that river and

15:54.280 --> 15:59.080
that's not as deep as it got it would get up to where it would nearly be to the windows on those

15:59.080 --> 16:04.600
trucks but the exhaust is up high enough that you could drive through there and you always had a

16:04.600 --> 16:11.160
raft of kids around you they would disappear from everywhere just like they do in any war I think

16:11.160 --> 16:18.360
sure and we'd feed them give them candy or whatever we could give them I had a group in

16:18.360 --> 16:23.640
way that I took care of for my tour over there there always when I got a chance to get them something

16:23.640 --> 16:33.320
special I got it okay this is a fantastic picture of a that's a fire base that's a marine firebase

16:34.280 --> 16:42.920
called GLA and this is an outpost that I'm at up on top of this mountain and I'm on guard duty

16:42.920 --> 16:46.840
because what I'm done up there I'm going up for guard duty and it's going to get night and

16:47.800 --> 16:53.960
and our job is is to protect the men that are sleeping down there and and those hootches that you see

16:54.680 --> 17:01.320
my hoot was directly behind me down below where I live like say I wasn't there but just a short

17:01.320 --> 17:07.320
pan I kind of wish I could have stayed there because so this photograph is pretty soon after you

17:07.320 --> 17:13.480
you arrived in country I hadn't been there very long I don't I didn't I'm we're going to see a

17:13.480 --> 17:18.200
photograph true towards the end of your tour here in a minute but right here I think we have a

17:18.200 --> 17:24.600
picture coming up of that's what time will it look like I don't know what we've got there but we've

17:24.600 --> 17:29.480
got we're loaded down with something and and we're going somewhere but I don't even know where that

17:29.480 --> 17:33.560
is I just wanted people to see an idea of what you know what we were talking about when we talked

17:33.560 --> 17:39.080
about the cod boy with the five done trucks and then I think now there you are towards the end of

17:39.080 --> 17:44.760
your tour and not a lot of meat on those bones you're on the left now it took me it took me a

17:46.200 --> 17:51.560
a bit hard on me I lost a lot of weight we didn't eat very much or very often and what you got

17:51.560 --> 17:56.120
with sea rations it wasn't a mess haul so and that's you and two other Texans right yes sir that's

17:56.760 --> 18:03.160
Jerry Smith on the right Greg Mahoney in the middle and myself on the left there was another guy

18:03.160 --> 18:08.520
of the four of us Texans in the same huge his his name was Goodrich and he was from college station

18:08.520 --> 18:15.640
but he was killed there and I don't know that I even have a picture of him here's a picture coming

18:15.640 --> 18:21.240
up of L. Z. Birmingham that's L. Z. Birmingham that's in the Ashaw Valley right most people think of

18:21.240 --> 18:29.240
Vietnam as a jungle but in the Ashaw Valley it's it's mostly scrubbed type Chenry that's a lot

18:29.240 --> 18:33.720
deeper than it looks I mean if you're looking at it it looks like that's not very deep but that

18:33.720 --> 18:40.360
Chenry is 12 15 feet tall so it's pretty thick but but not as lush and green as most people would

18:40.360 --> 18:45.560
think right and you mentioned the the church the Catholic church yeah that's the Catholic church

18:45.560 --> 18:51.720
in Hawaii I thought it was a remarkable building there in Hawaii I don't know that it exists today

18:51.720 --> 19:00.040
or not but it did then and I thought it was remarkable fascinating pictures you came back in

19:00.040 --> 19:07.160
April of 1969 rank of E4 assigned to the Commanding General office General John J. Sutherland

19:07.160 --> 19:13.960
and Fort Knox Kentucky and you you pride yourself as being one of the few people that have seen the

19:13.960 --> 19:20.360
gold at Fort Knox right I don't know what percentage of Americans are how many if you said out of

19:20.360 --> 19:29.320
one out of 10,000 or 100,000 but as a driver for Lieutenant General which three star general

19:30.200 --> 19:36.600
when he went there of course had the opportunity to go in too right now so I've been in it twice

19:36.600 --> 19:41.400
I've seen the gold I don't know how much gold there now but there was sure a lot of gold there

19:41.400 --> 19:48.680
in 1969 that was a fascinating tour General Sutherland ask you where you wanted to go you didn't

19:48.680 --> 19:52.520
want to go back to Vietnam Spain was your first choice he couldn't help you there but he sent you

19:52.520 --> 20:00.600
to Holland and then eventually and the place you were in Holland was sort of a relay station type of

20:00.600 --> 20:06.520
thing for communication communication for Vietnam right yeah it was it was a short wave radio

20:07.320 --> 20:13.560
connection and it was all of course encrypted and I was assigned there and there were 23 Americans

20:13.560 --> 20:18.600
at the Piong Cousern in Maustricht in the Netherlands right there for six months and then to a Baptist

20:18.600 --> 20:23.960
retreat in Mannheim Germany where you were a chaplain's assistant talk about that duty well I had

20:23.960 --> 20:30.040
gone well I had a Baptist retreat at Berchteskarten which is the Oberts Salzburg Hitler's retreat

20:31.000 --> 20:39.400
and we went to the General Walker Hotel and Major Leroy A. Sysk chaplain was there and his

20:39.400 --> 20:45.400
chaplain's assistant was going home and I just met him and we talked and he said would you

20:45.400 --> 20:50.840
be interested in being a chaplain's assistant in Germany and I told him a word so I got orders

20:50.840 --> 20:56.120
from transferred from Maustricht in the Netherlands to Mannheim Germany and was chaplain's assistant

20:56.200 --> 21:00.840
which was probably the best duty that any soldier could ever have like you said people didn't

21:00.840 --> 21:04.280
mess with the chaplain's assistant no they didn't they didn't you help soldiers along who'd

21:04.280 --> 21:09.880
gotten dear John letters and such like that and and it was a it was a good humanitarian duty which

21:09.880 --> 21:18.040
I know you liked very much you you got out of the army in January of 1971 you had really

21:18.040 --> 21:22.280
sort of become the spiritual leader there after the chaplain had gone home you came back to Texas

21:23.240 --> 21:29.160
to Stenat Texas in 1971 went back to school a little bit of time at Texas Tech then Howard

21:29.160 --> 21:33.400
Payne got your teaching degree taught for two years but then you joined the telephone company

21:33.400 --> 21:40.440
and you did that for 27 years that's right GTE and of course was never rising right but I

21:40.440 --> 21:46.600
worked with them and had had a wonderful career work with a lot of great people with the phone

21:46.600 --> 21:51.480
company and I have a lot of good friends and a lot of great memories of working with the phone

21:51.480 --> 21:56.200
company right I want to spend the time that we have left about six and a half minutes or so here

21:56.200 --> 22:01.000
talking about the American Legion because you are the proud commander of the American Legion the

22:01.000 --> 22:06.680
Earl Graham post one fifty nine in Brian that serves all of the brasses Valley talk a little bit

22:06.680 --> 22:10.920
about the Legion and the good work that it does I know one of the the programs that you all are

22:10.920 --> 22:17.720
most proud of is a boy state and girl state boy state and girl state boy state and girl state

22:17.720 --> 22:26.120
are magnificent programs of the American Legion this gives students the ability to go and function

22:26.120 --> 22:31.320
as a government go and actually run for office in a fictitious city in a fictitious

22:32.280 --> 22:38.360
county of a fictitious state and they run for a particular office now when they all get there

22:38.360 --> 22:43.240
they don't know what office they want to run for you know what office it would be but everyone

22:43.240 --> 22:51.880
has the opportunity to run for and be elected and this past year are two contestants from Brian

22:51.880 --> 22:58.360
College Station not only one boy state but they were sent to nation boys nation in Washington DC

22:58.360 --> 23:03.400
which there is only one from Texas only one from Texas they came from this post one five nine

23:03.960 --> 23:09.800
six district and so we're pretty pretty happy about that the national represent additional

23:09.800 --> 23:14.440
state of Texas indeed I know you said that you got involved with the American Legion just about

23:14.440 --> 23:19.560
I guess quite in 2006 or 2007 and one of the reasons you got involved with the American Legion is

23:19.560 --> 23:24.120
you wanted to be a part of the honor guard yeah it's something that the American Legion does and

23:24.120 --> 23:30.680
serves for for people who have passed for veteran to have passed talk a little bit about the

23:30.680 --> 23:36.360
honor guard for people that don't know what it does well the honor guards what what brought me to

23:36.360 --> 23:44.840
the American Legion I believe that the service that you know I'm not speaking for myself I'm

23:44.840 --> 23:52.920
speaking for the millions of others right that have served but when they leave this life I believe it's

23:53.640 --> 24:01.240
all together fitting and proper that we do military honors and we do that regularly in the

24:01.240 --> 24:11.240
Prattles Valley we do often two or three times a week and it's just the the process of the 21

24:11.240 --> 24:17.240
guns salute taps and presenting that flag to the family right and so that they can place that

24:17.240 --> 24:22.840
flag in a place of prominence in their home so that people that can come later and see that this

24:22.840 --> 24:30.680
is a home that was led by a person that served his nation right and that's what that's what the

24:30.680 --> 24:37.400
American Legion's really all about is Americanism exactly we're we're we're political but we're

24:37.400 --> 24:45.080
not partisan right but that's the thing about the American Legion that I'm most proud of is it's

24:45.080 --> 24:50.680
it's all about Americanism one thing that I know that you want to do and as a concern is that you

24:50.680 --> 24:55.880
know none of us you I anybody we're not getting any younger or World War II veterans are in their

24:55.880 --> 25:01.800
80s and 90s are Korean War veterans are in their 70s and and the Vietnam War veterans are getting

25:01.800 --> 25:07.800
into 60 and above and so getting younger veterans involved in American Legion is something that

25:07.800 --> 25:12.360
you're striving for and it's a it's a little bit of a challenge sometimes it is a challenge because

25:12.360 --> 25:19.640
of the the generational difference between say the Vietnam veterans and desert storm there's a

25:19.640 --> 25:26.120
long time in there and we're having to we're going to have to adapt American Legion VFW I'm also

25:26.120 --> 25:31.400
a life member of the DAV right we're going to have to adapt to bring those veterans inside these

25:31.400 --> 25:38.120
organizations so that they can represent the future generations that come you know I'd like to say

25:38.120 --> 25:46.840
that we won't be involved in war in the future but that's not a fact of life right right exactly freedom

25:46.840 --> 25:52.920
is not free and another thing that I know that you all do and and as the VFW and the DAV do is you

25:52.920 --> 25:59.400
send packages overseas to understand monthly care packages or packages with anything that the

25:59.400 --> 26:05.480
soldiers need right our our second commander Jerry Heights second vice commander Jerry Heights has

26:06.440 --> 26:13.560
faithfully been involved in sending packages overseas we send packages over on a regular basis

26:14.200 --> 26:19.320
and it's the kinds of things that soldiers need right the comfort items that they don't have

26:19.880 --> 26:25.320
you know we got some of that in Vietnam not very much but I'm sure would have liked to

26:25.320 --> 26:30.520
had it yes little things like Moissette Towel somebody sent me some of those one time and you can

26:30.520 --> 26:36.440
imagine the comfort of washing your face off when you haven't washed your face in a week especially

26:36.440 --> 26:41.640
in the conditions like you were in in Vietnam which the the men and women that are in Afghanistan

26:41.640 --> 26:47.480
and I right right now are in right now so little something special to eat yeah some some just

26:47.480 --> 26:53.320
anything that they can use we try to send the Irvran Post I know you all meet what the first

26:53.320 --> 27:00.440
