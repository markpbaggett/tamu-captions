00:00.000 --> 00:22.240
Enjoy the fun!

00:30.000 --> 00:34.160
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.720
I'm Tom Terbjaville.

00:36.720 --> 00:41.960
As important as any military detail of World War II, the military combat police providing

00:41.960 --> 00:45.000
personal protection for those conducting the war.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.840
And from time to time dealing with those soldiers who through their behavior might undermine

00:49.840 --> 00:51.360
the unity of the mission.

00:51.360 --> 00:56.680
Well Sergeant Tom Browning of Bryan was a member of one of the very first military combat police

00:56.680 --> 00:58.720
battalions of the U.S. Army.

00:58.720 --> 01:03.600
As a member of the 500 and 500 and 404th MPs he was quickly promoted.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.800
PFC, then Corporal, then Sergeant, then First Sergeant.

01:06.800 --> 01:12.440
And as a result of his duty was in December of 1944 awarded the Bronze Star Medal for

01:12.440 --> 01:17.680
what his captain called Maritorious Service in connection with military operations against

01:17.680 --> 01:20.840
an enemy of the United States in France.

01:20.840 --> 01:26.120
Later, as a member of the 500 and 12th military police where he was discharged from, Sergeant

01:26.120 --> 01:30.960
Browning had been attached to General George Patton's 3rd Army and pretty much followed

01:30.960 --> 01:33.480
Patton the duration of the war.

01:33.480 --> 01:37.640
Tom Browning, it is a pleasure to have you on the show of Veterans of the Valley.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.560
Let's talk about your growing up.

01:39.560 --> 01:45.080
You grew up in La Port and talk about how you got into the military service.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.680
Initially, it was with the cavalry, right?

01:47.680 --> 01:56.080
Yes, well I had been working around here there in Yarnight because a job for hard to find

01:56.080 --> 02:06.760
and I was in Corpus Christi and run out of job, run out of money.

02:06.760 --> 02:14.320
Here came a recruiting outpeed in the town and talked with him.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.160
He bought me a cup of coffee.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.160
We had quite a conversation.

02:21.160 --> 02:25.920
I had been born in a small farm.

02:25.920 --> 02:29.680
They had horses, they had to be fun.

02:29.680 --> 02:33.080
And you know for a year or two it was fun.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.080
Yes sir.

02:34.080 --> 02:41.240
How do you thought I knew a lot about horses and I did add full eggs, tail, other things like

02:41.240 --> 02:42.240
that.

02:42.240 --> 02:46.880
But a lot of things I had to learn about horse.

02:46.880 --> 02:51.560
And I find to learn some of those things.

02:51.560 --> 03:00.520
And we had spent a couple years along the border.

03:00.520 --> 03:05.480
Along about that time, several organizations along the border.

03:05.480 --> 03:11.800
This was two pairs of 12th Calvary and this was at Fort Brown, Brownville.

03:11.800 --> 03:18.760
And up the river about 100 miles was the second squadron of the 12th Calvary and that was

03:18.760 --> 03:20.040
at Fort Ringo.

03:20.040 --> 03:26.600
Well, the border was pretty well fortified along there.

03:26.600 --> 03:35.760
Of course, no one was trying to get into the United States then because of any trouble.

03:35.760 --> 03:41.480
Because if a job came open, there was about 300 people wanting their job.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.480
Exactly.

03:42.480 --> 03:48.120
And so border crossing was not a problem.

03:48.120 --> 03:57.240
Anyway, we had only had several maneuvers out in West Texas, first one place in another.

03:57.240 --> 04:05.440
And all of a sudden one day, you were eating a newspaper and all the news that was going

04:05.440 --> 04:06.440
on.

04:06.440 --> 04:12.440
The Japanese sank the USS Pan A in the Yankees River.

04:12.440 --> 04:19.280
Oh, God, I don't want to go to war in the Calvary.

04:19.280 --> 04:23.760
That type of war is old fashioned.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.400
What am I doing here?

04:26.400 --> 04:34.680
How contacted my dad and us as a contactee commanding officer telling him I'm needing on the

04:34.680 --> 04:38.800
farm and I think I can get a discharge.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.320
Well, he did and I got a dependency discharge.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.320
Yes, sir.

04:44.320 --> 04:47.880
But in doing so, I had joined regular army reserve.

04:47.880 --> 04:48.880
Right.

04:48.880 --> 04:53.120
Well, in 1941, they called me back in.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.400
Back back into the same organization.

04:56.400 --> 05:01.440
It was no longer in Port Brown.

05:01.440 --> 05:04.720
They had moved out to El Paso to...

05:04.720 --> 05:09.040
For Bliss?

05:09.040 --> 05:10.720
Yes, sir.

05:10.720 --> 05:17.120
And there was a lot of organizations around El Paso at that time.

05:17.120 --> 05:23.080
Well, I looked around and said, hey, I still don't know.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.080
I don't want in this Calvary.

05:25.080 --> 05:31.320
So in war, checked around, there was motorized Calvary there.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.720
I went over and talked with him.

05:33.720 --> 05:38.240
Oh, no, said, uh, we're full up.

05:38.240 --> 05:42.400
And said, you got good service before we're full up.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.480
Well, I said, I need to do something.

05:45.480 --> 05:49.680
I was doing a good war in this Calvary because here I am.

05:49.680 --> 05:50.680
Right.

05:50.680 --> 05:55.760
Well, I wrote a letter to Eligdon Field and got an answer back.

05:55.760 --> 06:03.880
I said, well, if you've got a 90 IQ, we'll set you in transfer here.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.120
Well, I had more than 90 IQ.

06:07.120 --> 06:11.520
And first saw it and come to commanding.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.160
Both of you are trying to get out of there.

06:14.160 --> 06:19.000
Well, I think everybody does that matter.

06:19.000 --> 06:28.440
He came and said, would you like to go over and form a military police outfit?

06:28.440 --> 06:29.440
Right.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.920
Well, give me the protectors.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.920
Well, he told me about it.

06:32.920 --> 06:37.920
Said it was first Calvary Division provisional military police company.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.920
Okay.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.320
Sound good.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.920
So I went to it.

06:43.920 --> 06:48.360
Well, he'd come, uh, Calvary men from everywhere.

06:48.360 --> 06:54.720
Well, I said, bunch of men I'd been with as a soldier.

06:54.720 --> 06:55.720
Uh-huh.

06:55.720 --> 07:01.720
And, uh, we farm and add different types of training.

07:01.720 --> 07:06.120
And this, that, and everyone owned for about 45 days.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.920
And they broke us up.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.720
Well, this didn't make sense.

07:10.280 --> 07:15.880
And it's right back to the same organization we came out of.

07:15.880 --> 07:20.320
First saw it and came to me and says, Brown and Don't draw equipment.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.920
Are you being transferred?

07:22.920 --> 07:23.920
Good.

07:23.920 --> 07:24.920
Where am I going?

07:24.920 --> 07:27.920
Fort Sam Houston.

07:27.920 --> 07:31.640
So you went there and that was really the first contingent of MPs that formed Fort

07:31.640 --> 07:33.400
Sam Houston at that time.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.920
And you talked to me about the people that were recruited there, uh, were ages between

07:37.920 --> 07:38.920
21 and 28.

07:38.920 --> 07:43.120
And these were pretty sharp guys that had all applied to Officer County School, right?

07:43.120 --> 07:49.000
Well, found out that, uh, in order to be in this organization, you had to have at

07:49.000 --> 07:50.720
least 110 IQs.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.720
Yes, sir.

07:51.720 --> 07:58.720
Uh, which is not, uh, brilliant by any stretch of the imagination, but you're no dumb

07:58.720 --> 07:59.720
bell either.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.720
Right.

08:00.720 --> 08:08.880
And, uh, so we looked and said, hey, uh, most of these guys are qualified for, uh,

08:08.880 --> 08:09.880
OCS.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.680
Well, a lot of them did.

08:11.680 --> 08:12.680
Went off to OCS.

08:12.680 --> 08:13.680
Uh-huh.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.680
They made options.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.240
Some of them came back to us.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.040
Some of them went to other organizations.

08:19.040 --> 08:26.960
And, uh, at the same time, well, uh, every place was hollering.

08:26.960 --> 08:35.160
This is new organization's farm, combat military police, as they've been heard of before.

08:35.160 --> 08:39.160
So they've wanted them.

08:39.160 --> 08:44.040
Well, they had an opportunity to go to Iceland.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.680
You were going to, you were going to be offered a promotion to go to Iceland.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.680
I was going to go to Iceland.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.680
What do you think of that?

08:49.680 --> 08:58.880
Well, I, uh, having been born and reared in a country where the mean temperature was about

08:58.880 --> 08:59.880
28 degrees.

08:59.880 --> 09:00.880
Uh-huh.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.880
I didn't want to go to Iceland.

09:02.880 --> 09:03.880
Wonder why.

09:03.880 --> 09:10.440
I think now, and I thought later that, uh, it would have been a good place for World

09:10.440 --> 09:12.240
War II.

09:12.240 --> 09:17.400
But I don't think I could have said the temperatures.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.400
Haha.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.720
Sergeant Browning, you were, uh, you were at Fort Sam Houston as a matter of fact on December

09:21.720 --> 09:26.400
7, 1941 when Pearl Harbor was attacked and when the world changed.

09:26.400 --> 09:30.800
Uh, talk about how it changed for you and sort of how you went from there and eventually

09:30.800 --> 09:31.800
got overseas.

09:31.800 --> 09:42.720
Well, they were forming several different combat military police battalions in because

09:42.720 --> 09:47.000
they had specific jobs.

09:47.000 --> 09:54.880
And they had never been formed before so they were organizing different ones to be sent

09:54.880 --> 09:55.880
out.

09:55.880 --> 10:03.000
Well, that's the reason for motions was so rapid and, uh, an entire company was sent

10:03.000 --> 10:09.400
off and, uh, it formed this entire battalion.

10:09.400 --> 10:17.640
And another one, uh, good, the contingent went off and formed the fact that I was all for

10:17.640 --> 10:22.440
an opportunity to go out as a first sergeant of it.

10:22.440 --> 10:28.800
But I turned it down because it was going to fort over, excuse me, fort over thought

10:28.800 --> 10:29.800
of George.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.800
Uh-huh.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.000
And, uh, what I had heard about that was not good.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Right.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.200
It was a desolate place.

10:38.200 --> 10:52.400
Anyhow, uh, the day that I heard that, uh, the Japanese and bomb Pearl Harbor, uh,

10:52.400 --> 11:03.920
I was the first sergeant and I'd been, uh, inviting these boys to, uh, I was the country

11:03.920 --> 11:08.800
and I was married at the time and I'd make friends with them and invite them to come and

11:08.800 --> 11:10.600
have it evening with me.

11:10.600 --> 11:18.040
Well, being a young man and married at that time will send him out a day of bliss.

11:18.040 --> 11:25.800
And, uh, so we, uh, didn't know anything about this until after they came and visited.

11:25.800 --> 11:26.800
Right.

11:26.800 --> 11:35.600
Well, the following day we were out on the Raffle Rage and we heard, uh, President Roosevelt

11:35.600 --> 11:38.120
declared the act of war.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.640
The day that would live in infamy is what he said.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.640
Yes.

11:41.640 --> 11:42.640
Let's, uh, let's move on.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.480
January the 1st, 1943.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.600
That was, uh, the day that you actually left Boston Harbor.

11:47.600 --> 11:53.040
That day we left, uh, what Sam Houston to go to, uh, to Boston.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.040
Boston.

11:54.040 --> 11:58.800
And then you, uh, you went the, the route through the North Atlantic, uh, from Boston.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.800
That was, that was some kind of a boat ride.

12:00.800 --> 12:07.080
That was the most stretches by the, uh, I understand that's the most stretches body of water.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.080
There is.

12:08.080 --> 12:11.280
You were on the USS Elizabeth C. Stanton at the time.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.280
Talk a little bit about it.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.960
Everybody got sick by the time they, uh, they got to Scotland, right?

12:15.960 --> 12:24.320
It was so, so rough that, uh, I said it was probably a, they used 90 percent of the

12:24.320 --> 12:28.360
people aboard ship were sick.

12:28.360 --> 12:36.800
And, uh, vomiting, it was something that was disagreeable even to think about.

12:36.800 --> 12:37.800
Indeed.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.800
That's what I'm seeing.

12:38.800 --> 12:45.920
It was so rough that, uh, if you went to the Mass Hall, he, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

12:45.960 --> 12:48.480
the table may buckle up while you're sitting there.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.480
Uh-huh.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.880
Is that, uh, that rough?

12:51.880 --> 12:55.520
Turns out that the Elizabeth C. Stanton was the, was the flagship of the convoy.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.520
Yeah.

12:56.520 --> 13:00.160
And you were the senior NCO on the, uh, on the, uh, on the Stanton.

13:00.160 --> 13:05.200
And, uh, you eventually landed in Scotland, got onto a train, but you all really didn't

13:05.200 --> 13:06.720
know where you were going.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.600
What you were heading to, you knew that you were, uh, you were about to be involved in

13:09.600 --> 13:10.600
war, though.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.600
Yeah.

13:11.600 --> 13:17.960
When you were in England, uh, when you were at war, it was any battle, but we were going

13:17.960 --> 13:19.880
to be a part of it.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.440
And that's all we knew at that time.

13:22.440 --> 13:26.160
And we went to, uh, I believe it was called Peel Rehole.

13:26.160 --> 13:31.400
How I'd got this name, I don't have any idea of what the name stood for.

13:31.400 --> 13:40.120
Uh, I remember one of the, uh, uh, gentlemen there that met.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.760
And, and, and, cabinet to visit church.

13:43.760 --> 13:48.160
And they said, this church is four and some odd years old.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.800
Is it all to have anything as old as you?

13:50.800 --> 13:57.160
Well, if we did, it's built by the Indians because we weren't even discovered by them.

13:57.160 --> 14:02.640
And, anyhow, uh, I'm going to, I'm going to show you a picture here as, uh, we're looking

14:02.640 --> 14:04.680
at it on the screen.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.640
And if you can, uh, you recognize that picture.

14:07.640 --> 14:12.880
This is you, I believe, on the, on the right on this picture.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.600
What can you tell us about that photograph?

14:15.600 --> 14:17.120
That is two France.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.120
Uh-huh.

14:18.120 --> 14:23.360
And, uh, yes, that's me sitting there.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.360
And.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.360
With one of your, uh, one of your war buddies.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.360
And.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.360
And in France.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.360
Very good.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.360
Oh.

14:31.360 --> 14:37.360
That's where we had quite a battle.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.360
And several things.

14:39.360 --> 14:43.880
The bench was happening long about that time.

14:43.880 --> 14:44.880
Uh-huh.

14:44.880 --> 14:55.840
Those, uh, one thing is we did as, uh, combat police was that we had to be the last

14:55.840 --> 14:57.960
disstand for army headquarters.

14:57.960 --> 14:58.960
Right.

14:58.960 --> 15:05.800
We had to maintain the entire, uh, MSR, the main supply route.

15:05.800 --> 15:06.800
Right.

15:06.800 --> 15:16.680
Um, things moved so fast there for a period of time that we actually had to have aircraft

15:16.680 --> 15:18.760
to never gasoline to it.

15:18.760 --> 15:19.760
Uh-huh.

15:19.760 --> 15:25.360
Because those tanks were moving so fast that the truck couldn't keep up with us.

15:25.360 --> 15:32.960
Well, uh, prisoners were here there and moved.

15:32.960 --> 15:33.960
Right.

15:33.960 --> 15:34.960
Here they moved.

15:34.960 --> 15:35.960
Yes sir.

15:35.960 --> 15:36.960
Yes.

15:36.960 --> 15:43.800
No, the thing that's happening as well is in France.

15:43.800 --> 15:47.560
Uh, a lot of these people who had been shot down.

15:47.560 --> 15:52.440
The French underground were bringing them in turn over to us.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.440
Uh-huh.

15:53.440 --> 16:00.480
The first thing they had to do was to go to army headquarters to be interrogated, grilled,

16:00.480 --> 16:05.120
and whatever, and then sent back.

16:05.120 --> 16:10.720
And you had lots of respect for these people who had done a great job.

16:10.720 --> 16:11.720
Indeed.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.720
Indeed.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.760
We're looking at another photograph now.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.160
I'm going to show it to you.

16:16.160 --> 16:21.760
This is you and two of your, uh, two of your army buddies sitting on a, on a Jeep.

16:21.760 --> 16:26.200
Can you recall, uh, and let you take a closer look at it yourself also?

16:26.200 --> 16:29.600
Can you, can you recall anything about that picture?

16:29.600 --> 16:31.600
Yeah, I can.

16:31.600 --> 16:42.440
Uh, I had a brother who was inducted into the army and my sister called and told me he

16:42.440 --> 16:46.080
was coming through replacement depot for Sam Houston.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.640
I knew all the first sawdons over there.

16:48.640 --> 16:54.360
We won't talk to him when he comes in, send him over to me and show him what I got

16:54.360 --> 16:55.360
here.

16:55.360 --> 17:01.520
He came over and said, uh, uh, have I been here?

17:01.560 --> 17:02.560
Oh, absolutely not.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.520
No way.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.680
You go and find your place.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.240
I have control of this place now.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.840
Um, well, he did.

17:12.840 --> 17:24.680
He became a sergeant and, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I've been to

17:24.680 --> 17:29.960
went through, uh, uh, Italy and, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, right.

17:29.960 --> 17:36.960
up to there. And I had written to him and told him I was being relieved of my duties. And

17:36.960 --> 17:46.840
I had written to told him to meet me in Brenner Pass, get a pass and meet me in Brenner

17:46.840 --> 17:57.280
Pass. Well, I shall be relieved of my duties. So I wasn't aware of what was taking place

17:57.280 --> 18:03.200
transfers of troops coming on. Right. Well, I went to Brenner Pass and spent the day there

18:03.200 --> 18:12.200
waiting for him. He didn't show up. I got back to the company and my mail said, we're

18:12.200 --> 18:22.180
in a whole Germany. I told him my driver is 9 o'clock. I said, sleep fast. We're going

18:22.180 --> 18:26.240
to whole Germany. Get up here 5 o'clock in the morning. We're going to whole Germany.

18:26.240 --> 18:31.880
Yes sir. And that was my brother and my driver on that Jeep. You were the person on the

18:31.880 --> 18:38.520
left on that last picture we saw. I want to picture wise if we can. Got another photograph

18:38.520 --> 18:42.080
coming up right now. We'll just look at that. That's another photograph of you on the

18:42.080 --> 18:49.280
left with some other of your buddies, young military police soldier there. I want to

18:49.280 --> 18:55.320
talk about you being attached to the headquarters company of General Patton. The first time

18:55.320 --> 19:01.240
that you came in contact with General Patton, you told me a story. You were a little bit surprised

19:01.240 --> 19:08.320
at what he sounded like, right? Well, yes. I had worked all known out in the all fields

19:08.320 --> 19:20.280
and anticipated well, I knew that these all drillers, all men are a big burly girl, Bruton

19:20.280 --> 19:31.480
and so was Patton. They had a voice to match their appearance. When the third on was

19:31.480 --> 19:45.760
farmed in Buehol in England, Patton assembled all the officers and in seals as the first three

19:45.760 --> 19:55.220
grades and explained to him what he had planned the force to do. When he got up there

19:55.220 --> 20:02.020
and speak and he had this pistol on his side and he looked so burped, and he had a sweet

20:02.020 --> 20:08.920
swivel, almost a feminine type voice you've ever heard, and the tithering and tattering

20:08.920 --> 20:18.520
him on because we all had suspected the same thing. And of course, he had quite a reputation.

20:18.520 --> 20:27.080
I will have to admit that he carried off what he said he would do.

20:27.080 --> 20:30.680
Indeed. We're looking at another photograph now that says you in the middle, just some other

20:30.680 --> 20:36.240
photographs from your World War II experience. What was following Patton like? What are some

20:36.240 --> 20:42.520
of your most vivid memories of being in the military combat police unit that was actually

20:42.520 --> 20:49.480
attached directly to the headquarters company of General Patton? What are some of your

20:49.480 --> 20:56.200
memories of him? Well, I'll have to admit I was in war, I knew I was in war, I knew

20:56.200 --> 21:09.640
that there were people who was after me, I was after people also. I felt that what am I

21:09.640 --> 21:19.640
doing here? Things are not as bad if you can see things happening and know what's happening

21:19.640 --> 21:26.160
why can't you invade them? Okay, that's going to be my policy because I remember doing

21:26.160 --> 21:34.480
that was in the second grade in high school that I remember reading something in the spelling

21:34.480 --> 21:40.440
book. Said good, better, best, never let it rest till the good is better and the better

21:40.440 --> 21:49.120
best. Well, that's the way I tried to make things when things got developed where it

21:49.120 --> 21:54.400
looked like it was going to be bad. I would try to make it good and if I could make it

21:54.400 --> 22:03.040
good, it would make better and that's where I lived, try to make it and that's fortunately,

22:03.040 --> 22:10.840
I think I was successful in some respects because I had a wonderful company and they respected

22:10.840 --> 22:16.600
me. The photograph that we're looking at now, I know you know the photograph, this is

22:16.600 --> 22:23.200
General Eisenhower inspecting some of your troops and you are the military police standing

22:23.200 --> 22:29.120
directly to the left behind General Eisenhower. What do you remember about how that meeting

22:29.120 --> 22:39.680
came about? Well, it was quite a funny thing. Patent didn't want to be stopped, patent

22:39.680 --> 22:50.120
going to go on to go on to Germany and going into Russia. This was something that was

22:50.120 --> 23:01.760
quite everybody knew it. Well, we had gone up to the Elbriever and being right with Army

23:01.760 --> 23:08.120
headquarters, there was a building there that had a large platform paid out in front of

23:08.120 --> 23:16.680
it. I saw it fell up there that I hadn't seen this uniform, who that is. Of course, I had

23:16.680 --> 23:25.920
seen all the uniforms that was basically in Allied forces and someone up and I introduced

23:25.920 --> 23:33.840
myself to him and the American. He grabbed my hand, shook it and said, Ryski, he hugged

23:33.840 --> 23:45.760
me on both sides. Well, I realized what we had done and so it is now. We had gone into

23:45.760 --> 23:58.720
Russian territory and was not supposed to be there. So we were ordered back and Patent

23:58.720 --> 24:08.200
said, I want you to get up 20 men with clean uniforms and we would have an Eisenhower's

24:08.200 --> 24:18.960
coming and I want to put on an honor program for him. Well, I found 14 men with clean uniforms

24:18.960 --> 24:24.800
and that was a difficult task. Right. And that's what that picture that we saw before.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.960
We're looking at a picture right now, a much more recent picture. I think this was taking

24:27.960 --> 24:38.640
just a year or so ago of the 61st reunion and you're cutting the cake. What were we looking

24:38.640 --> 24:46.920
at there? What was that reunion? Well, we mentioned this other picture. One of the things

24:46.920 --> 24:54.200
that happened to me was I now walked up to me and said, what cow-rout did you out of?

24:54.520 --> 25:05.280
Well, I told him, true past 12 caliber, so. Well, we were so busy after that. My comic

25:05.280 --> 25:10.840
manager didn't get to ask me about it. So he did ask me later after a reunion. Why? He

25:10.840 --> 25:19.160
had asked me that. Well, I explained it to him then. But the caliber actually had formed

25:19.160 --> 25:29.000
this organization. The first five or four military police battalion that had formed, the

25:29.000 --> 25:35.480
contingent was taken out of the cavalry. Well, I was the only caliber one they could find.

25:35.480 --> 25:41.760
It was still alive that knew anything about the formation of it. Well, they wanted all

25:41.760 --> 25:52.800
this information. So they paid my way to put this Washington and I said, I can't go, I can't

25:52.800 --> 26:07.560
see. And I had to use a walker. Had no problem. The son came and said, well dad, if you go, I'll

26:07.560 --> 26:18.200
pay my way and go out there with you. Okay, it's fine. I'll go. As I call him, ask him

26:18.200 --> 26:25.880
find me my walker. Oh no, we'll push you around the wheelchair. I'll never road the wheelchair

26:25.880 --> 26:31.160
so much on my life. I bet that's right. We're running out of time, Sergeant Browning. I know that

26:31.160 --> 26:36.440
your unit also was involved in the liberation of Berlin towards the end of World War II. And

26:37.320 --> 26:41.000
we want to thank you for your service. I wish we had more time to talk about your remarkable

26:41.000 --> 26:45.880
tour of duty. But most all, I salute you and thank you very much for your service. We appreciate

26:45.880 --> 26:52.280
you being here. Thank you, Sergeant Browning. Oh, thank you. Tom Browning served more than four
