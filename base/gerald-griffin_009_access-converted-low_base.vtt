Somebody'sThere Self

00:13.100 --> 00:16.400
Ah

00:16.400 --> 00:35.440
You know, not too many years ago, folks dreamed of linking great cities, not by road, not

00:35.440 --> 00:38.360
by rail, but by air.

00:38.360 --> 00:41.880
Journeys lasting days, reduced to hours.

00:41.880 --> 00:47.840
Now I guess we can pretty much take all that for granted, and I guess that in itself

00:47.840 --> 00:50.640
is a pretty good thing to celebrate.

01:11.880 --> 01:24.920
I grew up fascinated by this city, and later became fascinated by flight.

01:24.920 --> 01:28.200
Somehow each is influenced the growth of the other.

01:28.200 --> 01:33.320
My personal reward has come in being able to participate in both, and realizing that

01:33.320 --> 01:35.960
what has been achieved is more than notable.

01:35.960 --> 01:55.960
It's truly an occasion for celebration.

02:05.960 --> 02:18.400
To actually escape the bonds of Earth and venture into the vastness of outer space is

02:18.400 --> 02:23.240
an experience that can only leave one filled with wonder and with awe.

02:23.240 --> 02:28.640
But to realize that that ability has been achieved in less than a span of a single human

02:28.640 --> 02:53.920
lifetime is truly awesome, and it's an accomplishment that we all should celebrate.

02:53.920 --> 03:09.520
Over the years, I have visited a few hot spots in some of the strangest, most remote parts

03:09.520 --> 03:10.760
of the whole world they are.

03:10.760 --> 03:15.560
But it's still kind of amazing that you can go from Houston to almost anywhere in a matter

03:15.560 --> 03:17.160
of hours.

03:17.160 --> 03:20.360
Modern flight makes it possible for me to do my job.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.360
Without it I couldn't.

03:21.360 --> 03:36.360
I reckon that's a pretty good reason to celebrate.
