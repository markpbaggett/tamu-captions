00:00.000 --> 00:22.740
On July 24th, 1969, a date of human history largely forgotten, men from the moon first landed

00:22.740 --> 00:24.740
on planet Earth.

00:24.740 --> 00:30.860
I believe that this nation should commit itself, achieving the goal before this decade is

00:30.860 --> 00:35.860
out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth.

00:35.860 --> 00:43.260
The second equally critical portion of John F. Kennedy's 1961 challenge had been realized.

00:43.260 --> 00:49.260
The Apollo 11 crew, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, had flown a near perfect

00:49.260 --> 00:51.460
first mission to the moon.

00:51.460 --> 00:54.180
It would be a tough act to follow.

00:54.180 --> 00:57.420
These three astronauts were waiting to try.

00:57.420 --> 01:02.020
Charles Pete Conrad, Alan Bean and Dick Gordon.

01:02.020 --> 01:07.780
Thirty years later, the second crew to land on the moon got together to remember an electrifying

01:07.780 --> 01:13.940
launch, a pinpoint landing, and friendships forged to inflite.

01:13.940 --> 01:16.540
Here are their memories of that intrepid voyage.

02:16.540 --> 02:22.420
The crew of Apollo 12 were each chosen for the man's space program in its earliest days.

02:22.420 --> 02:27.380
Pete Conrad was a decorated Navy test pilot who graduated from Princeton University with

02:27.380 --> 02:29.860
a degree in aeronautical engineering.

02:29.860 --> 02:35.740
He had flown twice in the two-man Gemini program serving as commander on Gemini 11.

02:35.740 --> 02:40.060
Richard F. Gordon Jr. also flew in the Navy's test pilot program.

02:40.060 --> 02:43.940
He earned a chemical engineering degree from the University of Washington.

02:43.940 --> 02:50.100
Gordon came to NASA in the third group of astronauts and flew with Conrad on Gemini 11.

02:50.100 --> 02:54.940
Alan Elbein was chosen for the astronaut corps in 1963.

02:54.940 --> 02:59.900
Also in the Navy Labien, he had graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in aeronautical

02:59.900 --> 03:00.900
engineering.

03:00.900 --> 03:05.780
He had not flown in the space program but had served as backup on Gemini 10.

03:05.780 --> 03:10.900
I reported in in 62, the end of 62, and you guys came in the end of 63.

03:10.900 --> 03:14.020
We came in to NASA together and astronauts in the third group.

03:14.020 --> 03:18.140
Our selection was October 63.

03:18.140 --> 03:22.060
Pete was in the Mercury selection and he and I were together in the second selection

03:22.060 --> 03:23.380
group.

03:23.380 --> 03:26.220
He made it and I didn't.

03:26.220 --> 03:29.380
It had some psychological effect on me.

03:29.380 --> 03:35.620
But the main thing is that we raw Navy, raw carrier pilots and that's why all equipment

03:35.620 --> 03:40.900
performed so well because thick alumni all did our job and if you're a really good

03:40.900 --> 03:44.340
carrier pilot, like going to the moon was a piece of cake.

03:44.340 --> 03:49.940
The responsibility of selecting the Apollo crews fell to Donald Deak Slaten.

03:49.940 --> 03:54.620
Picked as one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, Slaten never flew in the program

03:54.620 --> 03:58.260
after a medical exam revealed a near regular heartbeat.

03:58.260 --> 04:03.260
He remained with NASA eventually to become director of flight crew operations.

04:03.260 --> 04:10.260
When the Gemini program was officially over the last flight being Gemini 12 and that

04:10.260 --> 04:16.540
was Jim Lovewell and Buzz Aldrin, I sort of remember Deak had a say on this with each

04:16.540 --> 04:23.500
potential crew commander or crew commander by calling them in and I can only speak on

04:23.500 --> 04:32.300
my case where he said you're going to be a crew commander and Dick's going to go fly

04:32.300 --> 04:40.460
your command module and he said here five guys you can pick a lab pilot and I wanted

04:40.460 --> 04:49.900
out and he was off doing something and you were working on the pilot pilot application.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.100
He called and ended up being in the pilot.

04:52.100 --> 04:56.580
And so I picked another fellow that had been a student of mine at test pilot school that

04:56.580 --> 04:58.100
I knew which was CC Williams.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.100
He was a Marine.

04:59.220 --> 05:04.540
Clifford C. Williams Jr. from Mobile, Alabama was a major in the Marine Corps and a graduate

05:04.540 --> 05:08.100
of the Navy Test Pilot School at Batuxent River, Maryland.

05:08.100 --> 05:15.460
We were training on nine and CC got killed in an airplane, right?

05:15.460 --> 05:20.100
And so I went and said okay, I was going to come, which he did.

05:20.100 --> 05:26.940
CC Williams died in the crash of his T-38 near Tallahassee, Florida on October 5, 1967.

05:26.940 --> 05:28.580
He was 35.

05:28.580 --> 05:33.820
The Apollo 12 mission patch carries a fourth star in his memory.

05:33.820 --> 05:38.020
It's interesting to me now that when CC got killed, it never dawned on me that I might

05:38.020 --> 05:39.020
replace him.

05:39.020 --> 05:41.820
I didn't even think about that sort of stuff anymore.

05:41.820 --> 05:47.500
And I was going out to the airplane one day to go somewhere to follow applications meeting

05:47.500 --> 05:52.900
and Pete says you got a minute and we went inside an area there and he said how would

05:52.900 --> 05:54.300
you like to fly with me?

05:54.300 --> 05:58.420
It caught me completely by surprise because I hadn't even been given up on it even though

05:58.420 --> 06:01.420
I had a broken heart about it.

06:01.420 --> 06:03.020
I'd given it, you know, I said well I've been in there.

06:03.020 --> 06:05.020
I've been surprised every chance.

06:05.020 --> 06:07.220
I've been stuck for a minute.

06:07.220 --> 06:12.740
Anyway, I knew that once you could get on a crew back up or prime, then you were in

06:12.740 --> 06:18.620
the rotation so we were going to back up nine so we'd probably fly 12.

06:18.620 --> 06:19.620
How do you get to the moon?

06:19.620 --> 06:21.940
The Intrepid Voyage will continue.

06:54.300 --> 07:15.340
The Intrepid Voyage will continue.

07:15.340 --> 07:18.380
Central to any NASA mission was the flight director.

07:18.380 --> 07:23.180
Gerald Griffin, a former Air Force pilot, had the responsibility of shepherding Apollo 12's

07:23.180 --> 07:24.980
trip to the moon.

07:24.980 --> 07:32.700
Mercury had just finished when I came to work for NASA and we had already had the challenge

07:32.700 --> 07:37.820
to go to the moon and if you really think about it, Gemini and Apollo were really kind of

07:37.820 --> 07:38.820
the same program.

07:38.820 --> 07:39.820
So it was Mercury.

07:39.820 --> 07:41.420
It was all leading toward a lunar landing.

07:41.420 --> 07:47.060
We actually started working on Apollo 12 well before Apollo 11 landed.

07:47.060 --> 07:50.860
Training for the lunar trip was extensive and repetitive.

07:50.860 --> 07:56.980
Formerous flights on the aptly named VAMIC Comet, a converted Boeing 707 which simulated

07:56.980 --> 08:02.020
weightlessness, gave the crew an opportunity to practice mission activities in near zero

08:02.020 --> 08:04.220
gravity.

08:04.220 --> 08:08.420
Scientific experiments would have to be placed on the lunar surface so Conrad and Bean

08:08.420 --> 08:11.180
were schooled on their deployment.

08:11.180 --> 08:15.540
Attention to detail and restricted adherence to specific timelines were essential to the

08:15.540 --> 08:17.940
mission's success.

08:17.940 --> 08:23.500
After months of training and countless simulations, launch time was finally at hand.

08:23.500 --> 08:30.740
On November 14, 1969, the crew of Apollo 12 sat atop the massive Saturn V waiting for

08:30.740 --> 08:32.780
a go from the controllers.

08:32.780 --> 08:35.420
We've simulated everything.

08:35.420 --> 08:39.820
I think the simulation in a training is probably much more difficult than the actual flight

08:39.820 --> 08:44.220
itself because you're dealing with emergencies in almost every instance.

08:44.220 --> 08:47.780
We'd been on the suits together in the command line.

08:47.780 --> 08:49.540
It was a familiar environment.

08:49.540 --> 08:50.540
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

08:50.540 --> 08:51.540
It was anticipatory.

08:51.540 --> 08:53.540
It was exciting.

08:53.540 --> 08:56.420
We were going to finally get to go.

08:56.420 --> 09:00.780
I had a more sense of relief than I did anything else.

09:00.780 --> 09:04.540
I got the trainings over and we get to go fly this thing.

09:04.540 --> 09:08.420
Of course, when we looked out the window, there was a black cloud and a little bit of rain

09:08.420 --> 09:09.420
coming down.

09:10.220 --> 09:14.740
My feeling there was that maybe we were not going.

09:14.740 --> 09:21.260
We've done this hundreds of times literally in the vehicle on the pad and also in the simulator.

09:21.260 --> 09:25.580
It wasn't until about 15 minutes prior to flight that I said to myself, you know, we're

09:25.580 --> 09:26.580
really going today.

09:26.580 --> 09:33.580
I think the big thing was that if you did scrub, it's not until the next day.

09:33.580 --> 09:35.380
It's you scrub for 28 days.

09:35.380 --> 09:38.220
You had to wait for a whole cycle.

09:38.220 --> 09:39.220
Looner cycle.

09:39.220 --> 09:40.220
Looner cycle.

09:40.220 --> 09:42.380
Yeah, I have to wait for a whole cycle.

09:42.380 --> 09:46.980
The Saturn launch vehicle has to be one of the greatest accomplishments of all time.

09:46.980 --> 09:54.860
Thank God for those Germans that we got after the war and that they congregated together

09:54.860 --> 10:01.180
under on Brown at Huntsville because those guys produced a vehicle that we have never seen

10:01.180 --> 10:04.260
anything like before, our sense.

10:04.260 --> 10:12.700
It was so big, 360 feet high and 32 feet in diameter or something like that at the

10:12.700 --> 10:17.340
first stage, really a massive, massive vehicle.

10:17.340 --> 10:22.500
The integrity of that giant booster would be put to the test just 36 seconds into the mission.

10:22.500 --> 10:27.580
The funny thing is all during training when Pete and Dick and I would be maybe having

10:27.580 --> 10:29.420
a drink afterwards or something.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.220
We'd say, boy, that was a tough day of training.

10:31.220 --> 10:32.820
We did this and this and pizzas.

10:32.820 --> 10:34.300
Yeah, we got to get this all done.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.300
We got to learn this.

10:35.300 --> 10:39.340
But if anything happens and it will, it'll be something we never trained for sometime

10:39.340 --> 10:40.340
during the mission.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.300
And Dick and I used to talk about that.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.300
Well, he knows best.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.300
He's the commander.

10:44.300 --> 10:46.340
36 seconds into the mission.

10:46.340 --> 10:48.140
Some maps we never trained for.

11:02.820 --> 11:20.740
The launch of Apollo 12 was into some weather that we had never launched in quite that

11:20.740 --> 11:21.740
bad before.

11:21.740 --> 11:25.780
We had launched in some weather, but not as much rain.

11:25.780 --> 11:31.180
It was my first time to be a flight director for a launch.

11:31.180 --> 11:32.180
So it happened.

11:32.180 --> 11:36.900
It also was the first time that the launch director at the Cape, Fellon and Walt Caprion,

11:36.900 --> 11:38.500
Cappy, we're calling.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.620
It was his first launch as a launch director.

11:41.620 --> 11:47.100
So Cappy and I were new to the game in terms we'd been through a zillion launches, but it

11:47.100 --> 11:51.620
was the first time that I had control at mission control and he had control at launch control.

11:51.620 --> 11:55.020
And the weather out the wind, though Pete was on and it could see it, but the ground was

11:55.020 --> 11:56.020
concerned.

11:56.020 --> 11:59.620
They had an airplane in flight to check for lightning.

11:59.620 --> 12:05.900
But there was one, was the last guy down and they said no, no thunderstorms.

12:05.900 --> 12:11.180
We did not have any indication that there was lightning in the area.

12:11.180 --> 12:15.340
And had there been a lot of lightning strikes or anything like that, I suspect we would

12:15.340 --> 12:16.940
have held.

12:16.940 --> 12:21.540
That final decision was actually made at the Cape, the launch director, and in this case

12:21.540 --> 12:22.660
was Walt Caprion.

12:22.660 --> 12:30.060
If we didn't go that day, the lunar cycle was 28 days, so we would have had to waited

12:30.060 --> 12:33.420
another month before we were going to fly.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.740
The present was there.

12:34.740 --> 12:35.740
Everything else was ready.

12:35.740 --> 12:37.220
It was, and nobody knew.

12:37.220 --> 12:42.740
I'd like to think that we didn't launch just because President Nicky, I would turn.

12:42.740 --> 12:43.740
But it was heavy.

12:43.740 --> 12:45.580
It was heavy rain.

12:45.580 --> 12:51.100
And there was no, I can tell you there's a myth that no reason we launched, because Nixon

12:51.100 --> 12:52.580
was there and that's not true.

12:52.580 --> 12:56.380
Nobody ever even talked about it.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.620
But we thought it was a good time to go.

12:57.620 --> 13:00.660
You know, you get one of these things that's Saturn 5, you get it loaded.

13:00.660 --> 13:01.660
It's a big job.

13:01.660 --> 13:05.060
There's a lot of high energy involved.

13:05.060 --> 13:09.220
And if you can launch, you'd rather go ahead and go rather than having to unload it and

13:09.220 --> 13:10.220
do that all again.

13:10.220 --> 13:14.860
But all these forces are involved and someone says, well, how about launching into a cloud?

13:14.860 --> 13:16.540
I'm sure they said, well, no, we never did.

13:16.540 --> 13:17.540
It looks okay to us.

13:17.540 --> 13:19.020
Well, our airplanes do cross.

13:19.020 --> 13:20.740
Our forces were ready to go.

13:20.740 --> 13:21.740
Yes.

13:21.740 --> 13:23.380
I think our boat was less large.

13:23.380 --> 13:33.820
10, 9, 8, ignition sequence 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, do it.

13:33.820 --> 13:34.820
All engines running.

13:34.820 --> 13:35.820
We finished.

13:35.820 --> 13:36.820
Lift that.

13:36.820 --> 13:37.820
We had lift that.

13:37.820 --> 13:38.820
1122, we have me.

13:38.820 --> 13:39.820
He's been standing time.

13:39.820 --> 13:40.820
We've been trying to have me repurchase.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.820
We have to have ram him.

13:41.820 --> 13:42.820
He was in.

13:42.820 --> 13:43.820
I have to have ram him.

13:43.820 --> 13:44.820
He was in.

13:44.820 --> 13:45.820
I have to have ram him.

13:45.820 --> 13:46.820
He was in.

13:46.820 --> 13:47.820
I have to have ram him.

13:47.820 --> 13:48.820
I'm picking all of them and I think he's really gone.

13:48.820 --> 13:49.820
He's gone right.

13:49.820 --> 13:50.820
I've been putting the rolling pin.

13:50.820 --> 13:51.820
You programmed to put a polygphilin on a proper course.

13:51.820 --> 13:52.820
A few seconds after launch.

13:52.820 --> 13:54.820
30, 40 seconds after launch.

13:54.820 --> 13:56.820
Something happened.

13:56.820 --> 13:57.820
40 seconds.

13:57.820 --> 13:58.820
Mark one, bro.

13:58.820 --> 14:14.820
This room, every light in here on these consoles, went bright.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.820
There was red lights.

14:17.820 --> 14:25.820
Pete started talking to us that he saw all kinds of lights in the cockpit, warning lights.

14:25.820 --> 14:27.820
Okay, we just lost the platform.

14:27.820 --> 14:28.820
I don't know what happened here.

14:28.820 --> 14:29.820
We had everything in the world dropout.

14:29.820 --> 14:30.820
Roger.

14:30.820 --> 14:31.820
Fuel cell lights in AC.

14:31.820 --> 14:32.820
Fun flight.

14:32.820 --> 14:33.820
Fuel cell.

14:33.820 --> 14:34.820
Just connect AC.

14:34.820 --> 14:35.820
Fun flight.

14:35.820 --> 14:37.820
Overload one and two main bus AP out.

14:37.820 --> 14:38.820
I don't know what happened.

14:38.820 --> 14:41.820
I'm not sure he can hit by lightning.

14:41.820 --> 14:46.820
My first thought was, I can't believe this is happening.

14:46.820 --> 14:53.820
We had 11 electrical warning lights associated with the electrical panel and in all our

14:53.820 --> 14:56.820
simulations, double failures and triple failures.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.820
They never figured out how to light all 11.

14:58.820 --> 14:59.820
We were a butt die.

14:59.820 --> 15:02.820
We had lost our data.

15:02.820 --> 15:05.820
We had no data here at all.

15:05.820 --> 15:11.820
And we were going strictly by his cues that something had happened.

15:11.820 --> 15:16.820
Pete's the guy that had the switch that aborted if something really went wrong, this bad.

15:16.820 --> 15:18.820
Because this was bad enough to abort.

15:18.820 --> 15:20.820
We thought we might have to abort.

15:20.820 --> 15:21.820
We never said that.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.820
You never say that word on the radio.

15:24.820 --> 15:26.820
For fear that it may be the only word they hear.

15:26.820 --> 15:31.820
Shortly thereafter, we lost the attitude reference system from the IMU.

15:31.820 --> 15:35.820
The primary ball just started doing this maneuver, tumbling.

15:35.820 --> 15:37.820
I think we lost now the ISF.

15:37.820 --> 15:41.820
The program, the one ball, just dripped it all over the place and we'll have to catch you.

15:41.820 --> 15:42.820
Roger, Dick.

15:42.820 --> 15:45.820
All five engines were still burning.

15:45.820 --> 15:49.820
I then looked at the front wall plot and we were gaining altitude.

15:49.820 --> 15:55.820
The GDC gyro display couper was driving a second reference system and it was okay.

15:55.820 --> 15:59.820
I said, e-com, what do you see?

15:59.820 --> 16:00.820
There was a delay.

16:00.820 --> 16:12.820
He said, stand by flight and then very shortly thereafter he said, have him put the SCE switch to AUX.

16:12.820 --> 16:18.820
And a young man, he was 23 years old, John Aaron, made that call.

16:18.820 --> 16:24.820
When John said SCE to AUX, I said, what?

16:24.820 --> 16:26.820
And he repeated it.

16:26.820 --> 16:31.820
And I turned to the capcom who had to get the message up to the crew and I said,

16:31.820 --> 16:33.820
SCE to AUX.

16:33.820 --> 16:37.820
And the capcom said, what?

16:37.820 --> 16:43.820
And finally, John came back in and he said, signal conditioning equipment to auxiliary.

16:43.820 --> 16:47.820
So the capcom, who was Jerry Carr, read it up that way.

16:47.820 --> 16:50.820
And thankfully, Al B. knew where that switch was.

16:50.820 --> 16:54.820
Apollo 12 Houston, try SCE to auxiliary over.

16:54.820 --> 16:57.820
And the AUX.

16:57.820 --> 17:00.820
SCE to AUX.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.820
I looked at those lights and looked at Al.

17:03.820 --> 17:06.820
I said, okay, Al, it's all yours.

17:06.820 --> 17:12.820
When he put the switch into the auxiliary position, voila, the whole room, we had data again.

17:12.820 --> 17:15.820
Literally, Al asked me why didn't I help him?

17:15.820 --> 17:16.820
I didn't get help.

17:16.820 --> 17:18.820
He wasn't helping us.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.820
He was just pulling us in the game right now.

17:21.820 --> 17:23.820
I didn't help.

17:23.820 --> 17:25.820
I didn't know what to do.

17:25.820 --> 17:29.820
And a board in that vehicle would not have been a very good thing to do.

17:29.820 --> 17:35.820
And the SCE tower that pulled this thing off and you didn't want to do it unless you really knew you had to.

17:35.820 --> 17:38.820
We became the longest lightning rod in history.

17:38.820 --> 17:41.820
We learned a lot that day on Apollo 12.

17:41.820 --> 17:44.820
We were all weather test pilots who wanted to go anyway.

17:44.820 --> 17:47.820
So that was our pitch decision that we should go on.

17:47.820 --> 17:48.820
They never did it again.

17:48.820 --> 17:50.820
I'd say that.

17:50.820 --> 17:54.820
Obviously, after that, we said, we'll never do that again.

18:12.820 --> 18:19.820
The Saturn V and its precious payload eased into Earth orbit,

18:19.820 --> 18:23.820
having overcome the extraordinary events during launch.

18:23.820 --> 18:26.820
An assessment of spacecraft systems was in order.

18:26.820 --> 18:30.820
Astronaut's safety was dependent on the integrity of the Apollo craft.

18:30.820 --> 18:34.820
Had the vehicle been damaged by the electrical charge.

18:35.820 --> 18:40.820
Expulsive events happened in staging and doing this, deploying parishes and whatnot.

18:40.820 --> 18:45.820
They were very concerned that the pyros may have been affected in a recovery system.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.820
There was one on the nose.

18:47.820 --> 18:50.820
They made the right decision.

18:50.820 --> 18:52.820
I didn't even think about it.

18:52.820 --> 18:54.820
I don't know whether you two guys did or not.

18:54.820 --> 18:55.820
I didn't think about it.

18:55.820 --> 18:57.820
Somebody told me about it 25 years later.

18:57.820 --> 18:59.820
I think that's exactly right.

18:59.820 --> 19:02.820
But they said, well, we better bring them back home.

19:02.820 --> 19:08.820
The punch line is, we'd have been as dead coming in from Earth orbit as we would come from the moon.

19:08.820 --> 19:09.820
So let's go.

19:09.820 --> 19:15.820
The story of how we made the decision to go on to the moon has, in my view,

19:15.820 --> 19:22.820
has kind of undergone some changes over the years, which is fairly typical.

19:22.820 --> 19:28.820
If that discussion was had and I was the flight director, it was never brought to my attention.

19:28.820 --> 19:31.820
We never talked about, at least in this room,

19:31.820 --> 19:34.820
somebody may have somewhere, but in this room we never talked about, well,

19:34.820 --> 19:37.820
we don't have anything to lose by going on to the moon.

19:37.820 --> 19:46.820
In fact, again, John Aaron, this young 23-year-old, 23-24, something like that,

19:46.820 --> 19:52.820
made the call that I think, the second call that he made,

19:52.820 --> 19:55.820
that I thought really made a difference in this flight.

19:55.820 --> 20:00.820
And he said, why don't we just go through the checklist just like we were going to do a T.E.I. burn.

20:00.820 --> 20:03.820
Trans-Earth injection to head home for the man.

20:03.820 --> 20:08.820
And if that looks okay, we're probably all right.

20:08.820 --> 20:13.820
So it was time to let Conrad and Company know that the trans-looner injection burn

20:13.820 --> 20:17.820
had been authorized and they were heading to the moon.

20:17.820 --> 20:22.820
Apollo 12 Houston, the good word is your go for TLI.

20:22.820 --> 20:25.820
Hope you do. We're ready.

20:25.820 --> 20:28.820
We didn't expect anything else.

20:28.820 --> 20:31.820
We didn't train for anything else, Pete.

20:31.820 --> 20:33.820
You better believe it.

20:33.820 --> 20:37.820
Saturn V performed exactly as it was supposed to do.

20:37.820 --> 20:43.820
It wasn't affected one bit in this performance by the instrument unit of the Saturn V,

20:43.820 --> 20:44.820
never built.

20:44.820 --> 20:48.820
And once we got collected and in orbit and re-aligned the platform,

20:48.820 --> 20:54.820
the only thing that we lost in the command module was the fuel quantity system for the RCS.

20:54.820 --> 20:59.820
The activity is going out to the moon and likewise coming back from the moon

20:59.820 --> 21:03.820
were fairly benign.

21:03.820 --> 21:08.820
And frankly, I think more for the crew than the ground, a little bit boring.

21:08.820 --> 21:11.820
The ground was busy the entire time.

21:11.820 --> 21:13.820
We never stopped.

21:13.820 --> 21:16.820
We could always figure out something to work on.

21:16.820 --> 21:19.820
We're trying to all these things that we didn't have in Jebady,

21:19.820 --> 21:23.820
like to pay for that shaving and I really have a ball up here.

21:24.820 --> 21:25.820
Roger.

21:25.820 --> 21:28.820
All dressed up and no place to go.

21:28.820 --> 21:33.820
Go hook on some place we can see get bigger and bigger all the time.

21:53.820 --> 22:03.820
The design and construction of the lunar lander began in the early 60s.

22:03.820 --> 22:07.820
It was an unattractive and angular transport.

22:07.820 --> 22:11.820
But pound-frying was a very important thing.

22:11.820 --> 22:16.820
The design and construction of the lunar lander began in the early 60s.

22:16.820 --> 22:19.820
It was an unattractive and angular transport.

22:19.820 --> 22:24.820
But pound-frying, the most efficient spacecraft ever made.

22:24.820 --> 22:29.820
The most absolute paramount concern on the land was how much it weighed.

22:29.820 --> 22:37.820
And so I was involved when we decided to take the seats out and that we would fly the vehicle standing up.

22:37.820 --> 22:46.820
I also was involved in doing all the egress work of getting out of the land to get down on a lunar surface.

22:46.820 --> 22:51.820
And this all took place in 64, 63, 64 time frame.

22:51.820 --> 22:56.820
We had a round hatch to come out and we had a square backpack and we could get it out of the round hatch.

22:56.820 --> 23:00.820
That was the one I was going to mention that was changed.

23:00.820 --> 23:03.820
And of course the round hatch wasn't satisfactory so we made it the square hatch.

23:03.820 --> 23:08.820
The thing I remember most was a meeting with Pete early on and Dick was there.

23:08.820 --> 23:12.820
And the government had all these neat controls and displays.

23:12.820 --> 23:17.820
And as I said, Pete was in charge of this thing.

23:17.820 --> 23:24.820
And Pete says to them, he says, why, what kind of gauges do you have on this ass-in engine?

23:24.820 --> 23:32.820
And they said, well, we've got this, tells you the pressure and the combustion chamber and how much fuel you have left and several other things.

23:32.820 --> 23:38.820
And Pete says, well, what do you do if the combustion pressure is too high?

23:38.820 --> 23:42.820
And nothing you can do. How about if it's too low? Nothing.

23:42.820 --> 23:46.820
Well, how about if your gas is too much? You can't do anything. How about too little?

23:46.820 --> 23:51.820
You can't do anything about that either. And Pete says, well, why don't you take the gauges out?

23:51.820 --> 23:56.820
I mean, if something goes wrong at least we'll be relaxed.

23:56.820 --> 24:01.820
Lunar orbit insertion was to take place on the far side of the moon.

24:01.820 --> 24:05.820
Only after the still-joined spacecraft came back from radio silence,

24:05.820 --> 24:09.820
wood controllers know if the engine burn was successful.

24:09.820 --> 24:12.820
Hello, 12 Houston.

24:12.820 --> 24:19.820
Hello, Houston. Yankee Clipper with Intrepid in tow has arrived on time.

24:19.820 --> 24:24.820
I guess like everybody else that just arrived, they're all free of us or plastered to the limit.

24:24.820 --> 24:31.820
A day later, November 19th, lunar module Intrepid separated from the Command Module Yankee Clipper.

24:31.820 --> 24:36.820
Allen Bean and Pete Conrad left Dick Gordon to orbit alone.

24:36.820 --> 24:39.820
Well, I was kind of sad to see them go, but happy for them.

24:39.820 --> 24:45.820
I've always answered that question that would it feel like we had to be all alone in orbit

24:45.820 --> 24:50.820
while your friends are on the lunar surface? I answer that by saying, if you knew these two guys would be,

24:50.820 --> 24:54.820
I'd rather get rid of them for just a little while.

24:54.820 --> 25:00.820
There he goes. I just want to wait there. Let that damp be.

25:00.820 --> 25:11.820
OK, I got minus one and nothing, so forget it.

25:11.820 --> 25:17.820
The lamb performed a flawless descent burn, again on the far side, and was headed for the lunar surface.

25:17.820 --> 25:23.820
We just watched the bird's bird rise, which was fantastic.

25:23.820 --> 25:30.820
The specific target below was a crater pattern resembling a snowman's body located in the ocean of storms.

25:30.820 --> 25:37.820
Waiting in that snowman was the lunar probe Surveyor 3, which had landed on the moon two years before.

25:37.820 --> 25:41.820
Pete would attempt to park the limb nearby.

25:41.820 --> 25:51.820
We knew we had these crater patterns that we were looking for, and gosh, you get the 7,500 feet.

25:51.820 --> 25:58.820
Your feet forward face up when it finally pitches over, and you really get a look.

25:58.820 --> 26:04.820
I looked at the window and it got to be 10,000 craters down there. I had a foggiest idea.

26:04.820 --> 26:06.820
Where am I?

26:06.820 --> 26:12.820
OK, you're out of 19,000 feet. I got something on my own. I used them out there. I got some craters too, but I don't know where I am yet.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.820
OK.

26:15.820 --> 26:18.820
And a bike with P64. OK.

26:18.820 --> 26:23.820
Now, it's kind of cheating. Look out there. I think I see my crater.

26:23.820 --> 26:31.820
And now, called out the right angle down that you could look through the site, and that's what was so fascinating because I mean here,

26:31.820 --> 26:35.820
there are literally 10,000 craters out there. Wherever you look, there's craters.

26:35.820 --> 26:41.820
And the guy should look down there and bang go that little crater pattern. Pop right up.

26:41.820 --> 26:44.820
I'm not sure. I'm in true seven.

26:44.820 --> 26:48.820
But have P60. P604, P. P604.

26:48.820 --> 26:51.820
There it is. There it is.

26:51.820 --> 26:53.820
I don't think I've gotten right down the middle of the road.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.820
Outstanding 42 degrees feet.

26:55.820 --> 27:00.820
And besides the right foot, there's a crater. I can't believe it. Amazing.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.820
It's passing.

27:02.820 --> 27:04.820
42 degrees feet.

27:04.820 --> 27:08.820
Just keep top-eyed again. I'm in down to about 99 feet a second. You're looking good.

27:08.820 --> 27:11.820
You can't look at me. I'm going for land over one.

27:11.820 --> 27:13.820
1,000,000.

27:13.820 --> 27:14.840
40 degrees.

27:14.840 --> 27:15.840
LPD.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.840
4X.

27:18.840 --> 27:19.840
4X.

27:19.840 --> 27:20.840
I can't believe it.

27:20.840 --> 27:21.840
You're at 2,000 feet.

27:21.840 --> 27:22.840
Boy's on the ground to OK. 1,800 feet up.

27:22.840 --> 27:23.840
39 degrees.

27:23.840 --> 27:24.840
38 degrees.

27:24.840 --> 27:25.840
36 degrees.

27:25.840 --> 27:26.840
You're 1,200 feet.

27:26.840 --> 27:29.840
They, 1,000 feet, come down at 30.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.840
Looks good out there.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.840
They look good.

27:33.840 --> 27:34.840
32 degrees.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.840
You're at 1,200 feet.

27:36.840 --> 27:37.840
33 degrees.

27:37.840 --> 27:38.840
600 feet.

27:38.840 --> 27:39.840
I think that's right.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.840
Why is that crater right where it's supposed to be?

27:42.840 --> 27:43.840
It is. You're beautiful.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.840
240, come down at 5.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.840
Hey, you're really maneuvering around.

27:47.840 --> 27:48.840
Yes.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.840
Come on down.

27:50.840 --> 27:51.840
OK.

27:51.840 --> 27:52.840
10% fuel.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.840
200 feet.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.840
Come down at 3.

27:56.840 --> 27:57.840
Easy, come on down.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.840
Thanks.

27:58.840 --> 27:59.840
180 feet.

27:59.840 --> 28:00.840
9%.

28:00.840 --> 28:01.840
You're looking good.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.840
I'm going to get some dust before long.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.840
96 feet, come down at 6.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.840
Slow down at the center.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.840
86 feet, come down at 4.

28:10.840 --> 28:11.840
You're looking good.

28:11.840 --> 28:13.840
50 feet, come in there.

28:13.840 --> 28:14.840
Watch for the dust.

28:14.840 --> 28:15.840
40, come down at 2.

28:15.840 --> 28:16.840
Looking good.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.840
Watch this.

28:17.840 --> 28:18.840
Come down at 2.

28:18.840 --> 28:19.840
3, you got plenty of gas.

28:19.840 --> 28:20.840
Play a gas, dude.

28:20.840 --> 28:21.840
Stay in there.

28:21.840 --> 28:22.840
30 seconds.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.840
13 feet, come down at 2.

28:24.840 --> 28:25.840
He's got it, ma'am.

28:25.840 --> 28:26.840
Come on in there.

28:26.840 --> 28:27.840
24 feet.

28:27.840 --> 28:28.840
Contact light.

28:28.840 --> 28:29.840
Roger.

28:29.840 --> 28:30.840
Copy contact.

28:30.840 --> 28:31.840
Pro.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.840
Yes.

28:32.840 --> 28:33.840
OK.

28:33.840 --> 28:34.840
It's firm off.

28:34.840 --> 28:35.840
OK.

28:35.840 --> 28:36.840
That's likely a foul.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.840
You got your standing command over right off.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.840
Yep.

28:40.840 --> 28:48.840
Turned out the resolution of the film was such that anything that wasn't 6 feet or bigger didn't show up.

28:48.840 --> 28:51.840
And there were some 5 foot boulders there.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.840
One no suitable spot.

28:53.840 --> 28:59.840
So flew around to the far side and the 2 o'clock position and landed.

28:59.840 --> 29:06.840
That's when Hal had not flown the LLTV and he makes a remark in there because I'm at home.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.840
I was just driving.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.840
I was used to find helicopters.

29:10.840 --> 29:17.840
And when you change direction in helicopters, you know you have a certain feeling on your bottom of your feet or your pants.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.840
And you were far exceeding that.

29:19.840 --> 29:20.840
I thought, what's he doing?

29:20.840 --> 29:22.840
But I didn't have time to look out.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.840
I had to keep looking at the computer trying to support you.

29:25.840 --> 29:26.840
But I was getting a little worried.

29:26.840 --> 29:27.840
What's he doing down here?

29:27.840 --> 29:31.840
So I was glad when you informed me it was going okay.

29:31.840 --> 29:37.840
One finally did land that I was really surprised how close to the edge of the crater I was behind me.

29:37.840 --> 29:40.840
I thought I'd given it plenty of room.

29:40.840 --> 29:48.840
The atmosphere in here was very much like Apollo 11 and the subsequent missions that came after 12.

29:48.840 --> 29:55.840
Quiet, disciplined, only the people talking that needed to be.

29:55.840 --> 30:05.840
Where Neil and Buzz had been more of a business like a bunch to deal with.

30:05.840 --> 30:10.840
Buzz and Neil were not ones to make big quips and all that.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.840
Contrast that with Conrad.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.840
He came right behind him.

30:14.840 --> 30:21.840
And Conrad was just all the time making a whiz-bang-laps-flap kind of thing.

30:21.840 --> 30:26.840
And his comments during the landing were Pete Conrad personified.

30:26.840 --> 30:31.840
And boy, we're coming right down with this baby right down the middle.

30:31.840 --> 30:36.840
And then his comment when he stepped off on the moon was very similar.

30:36.840 --> 30:41.840
Neil had been very historical and Pete was very funny.

30:41.840 --> 30:48.840
So the landing and listening to Pete, you could just tell he was having a ball.

30:48.840 --> 30:55.840
Those less than famous first words from the moon's third visitor when the intrepid voyage continues.

30:55.840 --> 31:17.840
That's one small step for man.

31:17.840 --> 31:24.840
One by a three.

31:24.840 --> 31:34.840
And then they have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.

31:34.840 --> 31:41.840
I had a way you're going that this person was convinced that we had big propaganda department.

31:41.840 --> 31:45.840
And Neil's words were done by the propaganda department.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.840
I said, I doubt that very seriously.

31:47.840 --> 31:50.840
I suspect that those words are pretty much Neil's.

31:50.840 --> 31:58.840
He may have gone and asked somebody for some help, but it was entirely up to him to figure out what he was going to say.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.840
And this person absolutely flat wouldn't believe me.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.840
So we had about 500 bucks.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.840
And I was the smallest guy in the office.

32:06.840 --> 32:09.840
And I said nobody remembers what it is.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.840
That's a person said anyhow.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.840
And so they let alone who they lost.

32:14.840 --> 32:23.840
And they think it's all I said, well, we'll just all say it may have been a big one, a little one for Neil, but it is a big one for a small fellow like me.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.840
And I think I left out small fellow.

32:25.840 --> 32:29.840
Did you ever collect?

32:29.840 --> 32:30.840
No, never.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.840
No, never paid.

32:32.840 --> 32:40.840
It wasn't long before Pete Conrad, now outside the limb, could see they had realized a prime goal of the mission.

32:40.840 --> 32:43.840
I don't ever believe it.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.840
That's what I see.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.840
That's what the side of the crater.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.840
Will it move there?

32:49.840 --> 32:51.840
Neil's there, yes sir.

32:51.840 --> 32:54.840
Does that look neat?

32:54.840 --> 32:58.840
It can't be any further six hours feet from here.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.840
How about that?

33:00.840 --> 33:06.840
Orbiting overhead, Dick Gordon spotted and trepid, and eventually the surveyor.

33:06.840 --> 33:09.840
I surveyor.

33:10.840 --> 33:11.840
Welcome, Clepper.

33:11.840 --> 33:20.840
Using these sextant, you don't really see the lunar module, see the surveyor crater, but I was so confident of our tracking landmarks.

33:20.840 --> 33:30.840
When I heard Pete say there was the old surveyor, that I could see the lunar module as a bright spot of light with a very long pencil-like shadow.

33:30.840 --> 33:33.840
We didn't have the rover at that time.

33:33.840 --> 33:39.840
We had to walk everywhere, and we wanted to make sure we explored certain areas and got to the surveyor.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.840
We had to be near that crater because if we weren't, you never got there.

33:42.840 --> 33:45.840
We never got there, we couldn't have found it, couldn't have gotten there.

33:45.840 --> 33:49.840
That's the first thing we talked about it in time, several times.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.840
Pete would say, when I get down on a go-look and see if the surveyor is there.

33:52.840 --> 33:56.840
We wanted, and sure enough, that's the first thing you said.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.840
First thing you said, there's the old surveyor.

33:58.840 --> 34:06.840
Because then we knew our second EVA, which we would go to surveyor, we actually had somewhere to go and we'd probably get to parts and do the things that we were supposed to do.

34:06.840 --> 34:11.840
Pete Conrad began to collect soil samples in case a quick departure was needed.

34:11.840 --> 34:15.840
His obvious enjoyment in his work would have made the Seven Dwarves proud.

34:15.840 --> 34:20.840
Hey, Al, get work out of here all day. Take your time.

34:28.840 --> 34:34.840
Al being joined Pete on the surface.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.840
Good shape. Here I pull the hatch cord here.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.840
Okay. Don't lock it.

34:45.840 --> 34:49.840
Stand by the landed 20 feet behind where I landed.

34:49.840 --> 34:52.840
Lean the landed right, back in that crater.

34:53.840 --> 35:01.840
The sole setback for the Apollo 12 crew was the failure of the color camera that was to be deployed for live television.

35:01.840 --> 35:04.840
Okay, you can improve the TAD camera now.

35:04.840 --> 35:07.840
First place, the camera on the wheels flight was black and white.

35:07.840 --> 35:13.840
We had the first color camera, which we never laid our eyes on until we were on a lunar surface.

35:13.840 --> 35:18.840
We always played with a block. I think we might have seen it when they stowed it.

35:18.840 --> 35:23.840
But if I remember, I didn't show up. I told about four days before the flight.

35:23.840 --> 35:29.840
And so we had never, ever had an opportunity to do anything with that camera.

35:29.840 --> 35:33.840
It was on the basis. So when you came down, it showed you.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.840
And then you were out there about 15 minutes collecting a sample.

35:36.840 --> 35:41.840
In case we had to leave early, we'd leave to have some rocks and doing some other things, spotting surveyor.

35:41.840 --> 35:47.840
Then I got down. And my first job was to take it out of there and put it on the surface and point it towards us.

35:47.840 --> 35:50.840
So everybody on earth could see what we were doing.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.840
There was real nice moving around out there.

35:52.840 --> 35:55.840
It won't seem to get tired.

35:55.840 --> 35:59.840
It's really hot like a bunny.

35:59.840 --> 36:05.840
There, over where it is. There it is.

36:05.840 --> 36:08.840
Can you hear the TV?

36:08.840 --> 36:09.840
And?

36:09.840 --> 36:11.840
Can you see it?

36:11.840 --> 36:14.840
Wait, towards the sun. That's there.

36:14.840 --> 36:19.840
I didn't know and should have known that you can't point a TV camera to the sun.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.840
I mean, everybody knows that. Every school kid knows that.

36:22.840 --> 36:27.840
I didn't know it. So when I took it out, I wasn't careful at all. And I pointed it at the sun.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.840
How does that look, Houston?

36:30.840 --> 36:32.840
It still looks the same, El.

36:32.840 --> 36:38.840
We have a very bright image at the top and blanked out at the top for 80% of the bottom.

36:38.840 --> 36:42.840
When he set it up, it was just one of these things that happened.

36:42.840 --> 36:48.840
It had enough of the sun in the field of view that it burned out the sensing device.

36:48.840 --> 36:51.840
And I don't know, I guess the guts of it.

36:51.840 --> 36:58.840
And so we ended up without any television for that little bit of peace in the very front end.

36:58.840 --> 37:01.840
We were already airborne on the 14th of November.

37:01.840 --> 37:11.840
When we got back, there was this NASA letterhead paper sitting on the top of my desk back at NASA after all the whole thing was over.

37:11.840 --> 37:17.840
And it was a whole thing about no point to camera into the sun, but it was dated 17 November.

37:17.840 --> 37:25.840
A little side story there, Albein is from the same hometown I am, Fort Worth, Texas.

37:25.840 --> 37:29.840
And I went to Arlington Heights High School. He went to Pasquale High School.

37:29.840 --> 37:34.840
So we were always rivals.

37:34.840 --> 37:38.840
We didn't know each other till a space program. But anyway, in those days we were rivals.

37:38.840 --> 37:44.840
And then, as fate would have it, he went off to the University of Texas to get his college degree.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.840
I went to Texas A&M University.

37:47.840 --> 37:50.840
So again, we were in the rivals.

37:50.840 --> 38:01.840
Well, when the thing happened with the camera, it gave me great pleasure to tell him that those Pasquale guys and those University of Texas guys just never had it figured out.

38:01.840 --> 38:07.840
If they'd seen an Aggie or Arlington Heights High School graduate or something like that up there, we'd have done it right.

38:07.840 --> 38:14.840
While exploring the ocean of storms, Conrad and Bean found they had some unexpected company.

38:14.840 --> 38:23.840
The spiral notebooks attached to the cuffs of their spacesuits had instructions for reference during EVAs, along with a surprise or two.

38:23.840 --> 38:36.840
All the flight equipment is stowed on board after its final review by the backup crew, who make sure that everything is there and operative.

38:36.840 --> 38:42.840
And it seems like our backup crew put a few additions into our cuffs checklist.

38:42.840 --> 38:46.840
First they had some drawings in there that were like Snoopy.

38:46.840 --> 38:49.840
And there were some in jokes on them.

38:49.840 --> 38:53.840
And I got out on the lunar surface and I'm minding my own business.

38:53.840 --> 38:57.840
And I get through a couple of pages and laugh at the little Snoopy jokes.

38:57.840 --> 39:03.840
And all of a sudden I get to a page and open it up and it's the play made of the month.

39:03.840 --> 39:08.840
And what they did was put the girl in there that seemed to fit what we were doing at the time.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.840
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, what were you doing?

39:11.840 --> 39:15.840
Studying Hills and Valley, trying to make some observations.

39:15.840 --> 39:18.840
So there's always a little clever about what we were doing.

39:18.840 --> 39:22.840
And the best part of it is though we never did say anything.

39:22.840 --> 39:27.840
It was a good 20-some years before anybody said anything publicly.

39:27.840 --> 39:31.840
You still have your cuff checklist and I still have mine.

39:31.840 --> 39:36.840
Back up crew and the prime crew were always doing things to each other

39:36.840 --> 39:41.840
that they didn't tell anybody about and clippin' us in the control center.

39:41.840 --> 39:48.840
And the fact that Pete was kind of giddy and giggling and all, that was Pete.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.840
That's the way he was all the time.

39:50.840 --> 39:54.840
Both astronauts were excited about where they were and what they were doing.

39:54.840 --> 39:58.840
They knew how fortunate they were to be experiencing the adventure,

39:58.840 --> 40:01.840
but still felt some regret.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.840
Just didn't last long enough.

40:03.840 --> 40:06.840
We were out two different times for about three and a half hours each.

40:06.840 --> 40:09.840
It just went right by.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.840
You know, you train for all those times.

40:11.840 --> 40:12.840
You want to spend more time.

40:12.840 --> 40:16.840
You want to spend three or four days there and be out eight hours each day.

40:16.840 --> 40:20.840
Is that why when you got back and the phrase was, is that all there is?

40:20.840 --> 40:21.840
It kind of was.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.840
Well, we need to do more of this.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.840
I mean, we just got here and here we're leaving.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.840
Well, in the year you hit a very good point.

40:28.840 --> 40:33.840
We had exactly the same portable life support system the rest of the guys did,

40:33.840 --> 40:35.840
but NASA was so cautious.

40:35.840 --> 40:39.840
And that was my one frustration because you don't get tired.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.840
No, you don't get tired.

40:41.840 --> 40:46.840
And the fact that they made us come back in even on the first EVA.

40:46.840 --> 40:49.840
I mean, they were not going to let us go by four hours.

40:49.840 --> 40:52.840
If I have a frustration today, it's what you just said.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.840
Not being able to stay out longer.

40:54.840 --> 40:57.840
I think you got to go a longer time on the EVA.

40:57.840 --> 41:03.840
We've felt badly sooner than we got shut off the other day.

41:03.840 --> 41:08.840
Although we didn't have to date it real time.

41:08.840 --> 41:12.840
But we have agreement with the ground that we weren't going to go past the four hours.

41:12.840 --> 41:14.840
But we had six hours where it was consumable.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.840
So we got not early on the second EVA.

41:17.840 --> 41:21.840
And as far as the entire thing we weren't tired, we were we could have kept on going.

41:21.840 --> 41:24.840
We hustled to get back just to make our four hour deadline.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.840
It doesn't have any schedule here in here.

41:54.840 --> 42:03.840
It has no schedule here and it seems like an appointment to the airport.

42:03.840 --> 42:07.840
I think it was a little Christmas time.

42:07.840 --> 42:20.760
As time for leaving the moon drew near, Alan Bean began to be concerned the lone booster

42:20.760 --> 42:24.600
rocket beneath them might not operate when called upon.

42:24.600 --> 42:27.360
I wasn't calm and I was Pete Luxover.

42:27.360 --> 42:28.360
It's easy.

42:28.360 --> 42:34.360
I had been saying for a while, Pete Luxover, is there anything worrying you or something?

42:34.360 --> 42:37.040
And I said, yeah, I'm kind of worried if they put this all together.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.300
I mean, we're not going to be here.

42:38.300 --> 42:41.800
And then you, in order to calm my nerves, you say, what?

42:41.800 --> 42:44.660
I said, don't worry, bad if it doesn't light.

42:44.660 --> 42:49.820
We'll become the first permanent monument to the US Space Program on the moon.

42:49.820 --> 42:51.820
That made me feel good.

42:51.820 --> 42:52.820
Three, two, one.

42:52.820 --> 42:53.820
That's gone.

42:53.820 --> 42:54.820
I mean, I'll let you go.

42:54.820 --> 42:55.820
I'll let you go.

42:55.820 --> 43:02.820
You're going to the sun.

43:02.820 --> 43:04.820
Right our way.

43:04.820 --> 43:07.820
And it wasn't going to go like 20 feet.

43:07.820 --> 43:08.820
Oh, yeah.

43:08.820 --> 43:13.700
It's a pretty quick ride if I remember it's like six minutes or six minutes or so.

43:13.700 --> 43:16.220
With no gauges or anything to know how it's going.

43:16.220 --> 43:17.220
No sound.

43:17.220 --> 43:18.220
Yeah.

43:18.220 --> 43:22.420
And you get your guidance gauges, which you're telling you, you're on the trajectory

43:22.420 --> 43:25.420
and everything.

43:25.420 --> 43:31.420
The big shock right off the bat, though, as soon as we shut down, why we disappeared

43:31.420 --> 43:35.420
in this little black cloud.

43:35.420 --> 43:36.420
Inside.

43:36.420 --> 43:37.420
Inside.

43:37.420 --> 43:38.420
Yeah.

43:38.420 --> 43:47.540
We had stayed with our face plates and everything on because we were so dirty and we had this dusty

43:47.540 --> 43:51.660
cloud and zero G inside there.

43:51.660 --> 43:57.900
And that's when we found out how persecuity dick was because when we got joined up, we

43:57.900 --> 44:01.260
were ready to get back on board and have a good time.

44:01.260 --> 44:02.260
You just let us in.

44:02.260 --> 44:03.260
Two, three.

44:03.260 --> 44:10.580
Four, five, six, seven, seven years are off.

44:10.580 --> 44:11.580
I really crashed it burned.

44:11.580 --> 44:12.580
I remember there.

44:12.580 --> 44:13.580
I was tired.

44:13.580 --> 44:14.580
Well, people were tired.

44:14.580 --> 44:15.580
They were both tired.

44:15.580 --> 44:18.540
We had some activities in the lunar orbit.

44:18.540 --> 44:24.540
One mark cracking, photographing various craters and areas of moon.

44:24.540 --> 44:25.980
That was sort of my task.

44:25.980 --> 44:31.020
But leaving the moon, I didn't really have a melancholy.

44:31.020 --> 44:33.980
You're wrapped up in a T.E.I.

44:33.980 --> 44:34.980
Transurf injection.

44:34.980 --> 44:40.740
You're concerned that the SPSA is just going to perform properly.

44:40.740 --> 44:42.820
You're not concerned about it.

44:42.820 --> 44:47.180
There was another one of those dynamic times where you have to make sure everything is

44:47.180 --> 44:48.180
right.

44:48.180 --> 44:51.180
Now, the only thing you got left is reentry.

44:51.180 --> 44:53.900
It took about six minutes to enter.

44:53.900 --> 44:54.900
Dick was flying the engine.

44:54.900 --> 44:55.900
Eight minutes?

44:55.900 --> 44:56.900
Eight minutes.

44:56.900 --> 44:58.900
We actually got the six G's.

44:58.900 --> 44:59.900
It's a reentry.

44:59.900 --> 45:00.900
Yeah.

45:00.900 --> 45:07.260
What you do, you start with a lift vector down so the spacecraft flies into the atmosphere.

45:07.260 --> 45:10.900
Once it gets subsurptured, less than orbit will blossom.

45:10.900 --> 45:11.900
Where you can't skip out.

45:11.900 --> 45:16.140
Then you start maneuvering around with the simple.

45:16.140 --> 45:19.500
That's a very, very kind of pretty looking out the window.

45:19.500 --> 45:20.500
Yeah, a lot of that.

45:20.500 --> 45:23.900
And I remember feeling slowing down and all of a sudden I thought, well, we're bound

45:23.900 --> 45:25.700
to be just about ready to...

45:25.700 --> 45:26.900
I didn't have a clock in front of me.

45:26.900 --> 45:27.900
It was over near Pete and Dick.

45:27.900 --> 45:31.820
So I said, how much more we got to go?

45:31.820 --> 45:33.300
You said something like five minutes.

45:33.300 --> 45:34.300
I don't want.

45:34.300 --> 45:35.820
We must have slowed down thousands.

45:35.820 --> 45:37.540
It's a funny part that I didn't.

45:37.540 --> 45:41.500
We have to cut the droves loose before the main parachute's come out.

45:41.500 --> 45:42.820
So they don't tang a lot?

45:42.820 --> 45:46.740
So you get rid of the droves and then there's that moment that you have no parachute.

45:46.740 --> 45:50.740
We can't even get closer to the mainstam out.

45:50.740 --> 45:54.500
And that's when it's really all over.

45:54.500 --> 45:55.980
Well, that's what I thought.

45:55.980 --> 45:57.380
Yeah, it's really all over then.

45:57.380 --> 46:02.220
And so I'm setting up the camera in the window and just looking out at the droves.

46:02.220 --> 46:04.020
And the mainstam out there, we got some great shots of that.

46:04.020 --> 46:07.020
By the way, thanks to me.

46:07.020 --> 46:09.380
So I think, you know, I look at my checklist.

46:09.380 --> 46:12.580
My checklist is remove camera from window.

46:12.580 --> 46:15.100
I think, why bother?

46:15.100 --> 46:17.540
Why bother on earth here almost?

46:17.540 --> 46:19.060
So I didn't move that thing off.

46:19.060 --> 46:22.220
You know, you got to turn around and put it in the bag and we're almost on the water.

46:22.220 --> 46:25.020
And so I'm just setting there thinking this is great.

46:25.020 --> 46:26.860
And it hits the water.

46:26.860 --> 46:29.060
Bang, and I think, man, that's hard.

46:29.060 --> 46:33.660
I've noticed that Dick and Peter looking at me and they're saying, punching the burgers.

46:33.660 --> 46:34.660
What's the hurry?

46:34.660 --> 46:36.660
You know, we just got up here.

46:36.660 --> 46:37.660
We just got here.

46:37.660 --> 46:38.660
We've got them.

46:38.660 --> 46:39.660
I didn't know this.

46:39.660 --> 46:42.500
I'd been banged in head with that camera.

46:42.500 --> 46:43.900
I didn't even know it at the time.

46:43.900 --> 46:44.900
And so I punched in the circuit.

46:44.900 --> 46:49.780
Right, it was only later when you're looking at me seeing, where you been.

46:49.780 --> 46:58.020
We didn't find out till later that the camera had come off the bracket and hit Al in the

46:58.020 --> 47:00.180
head.

47:00.180 --> 47:03.420
We saw them go stable too, which we never met.

47:03.420 --> 47:08.220
The caps were flipped over and they hit them with plates and bags to get it back.

47:08.220 --> 47:14.420
But we were in communication with them and everything sounded fine to us.

47:14.420 --> 47:19.260
And I don't guess in real time they wanted to admit that one of the guys had gotten hit

47:19.260 --> 47:20.260
with a camera.

47:20.260 --> 47:21.700
That I think he should have stowed.

47:21.700 --> 47:26.940
I think the procedures call for him to stow it and he didn't.

47:26.940 --> 47:31.980
But again, that's like University of Texas, you know, thing versus Texas anyway.

47:31.980 --> 47:32.980
It'd been an Aggie.

47:32.980 --> 47:34.380
He didn't do it right.

47:34.380 --> 47:38.580
After the spacecraft had been retrieved, the crew was placed in quarantine in case they

47:38.580 --> 47:40.900
brought back any lunar germs.

47:40.900 --> 47:45.060
So when we walked out the door, we were done 21 days later from when we left the moon,

47:45.060 --> 47:49.460
which was only what, a couple of weeks on Macon Earth, we were finished.

47:49.460 --> 47:51.100
We'd done all the work.

47:51.100 --> 47:52.100
We could go enjoy ourselves.

47:52.100 --> 47:54.100
It was a good deal, kind of.

47:54.100 --> 48:00.260
And I also learned that fame is fleeting because I went out the door and my kids were in

48:00.260 --> 48:03.380
school and my wife was someplace else.

48:03.380 --> 48:08.940
And that only person that was around was a photographer wanted to see this big welcome

48:08.940 --> 48:09.940
home.

48:09.940 --> 48:13.980
And there I am putting the key in the back door of the house all by myself.

48:13.980 --> 48:14.980
And that was dad.

48:14.980 --> 48:17.340
And my poor guy goes home, nobody's there.

48:17.340 --> 48:20.020
Well, it's just another day at the office.

48:20.020 --> 48:21.020
He's lucky.

48:21.020 --> 48:23.020
He had a key to the house.

48:30.260 --> 48:31.260
So, I'm going to go to the office.

48:31.260 --> 48:32.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:32.260 --> 48:33.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:33.260 --> 48:34.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:34.260 --> 48:35.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:35.260 --> 48:36.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:36.260 --> 48:37.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:37.260 --> 48:38.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:38.260 --> 48:39.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:39.260 --> 48:40.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:40.260 --> 48:41.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:41.260 --> 48:42.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:42.260 --> 48:43.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:43.260 --> 48:44.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:44.260 --> 48:45.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:45.260 --> 48:46.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:46.260 --> 48:47.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:47.260 --> 48:48.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:48.260 --> 48:49.260
I'm going to go to the office.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.260
I'm going to go to the office.

49:00.260 --> 49:10.260
I'm going to go to the office.

49:10.260 --> 49:12.260
I'm going to go to the office.

49:12.260 --> 49:14.260
I'm going to go to the office.

49:14.260 --> 49:16.260
I'm going to go to the office.

49:16.260 --> 49:18.260
Apollo 11 first put a man on lunar soil.

49:18.260 --> 49:20.260
And the words the eagle has landed

49:20.260 --> 49:22.260
echo a singular human experience.

49:22.260 --> 49:25.260
Apollo 13 has been immortalized by Hollywood

49:25.260 --> 49:29.260
as an endeavor gone wrong, saved by indomitable humans.

49:29.260 --> 49:32.260
And the word was called by indomitable human spirit

49:32.260 --> 49:33.260
and determination.

49:33.260 --> 49:36.260
Although the Apollo 12 flight is today less well known

49:36.260 --> 49:40.260
than either Apollo 11 or 13, the crew of 12

49:40.260 --> 49:43.260
never felt their flight was any less appreciated than the missions

49:43.260 --> 49:45.260
which preceded and followed theirs.

49:45.260 --> 49:47.260
You don't remember who flew the Atlantic second?

49:47.260 --> 49:49.260
You don't know who transplanted the second heart.

49:49.260 --> 49:53.260
That was an example I would use.

49:53.260 --> 49:57.260
I never felt left out between 11 and 13.

49:57.260 --> 50:00.260
I was just glad 13 didn't happen to us because we got a chance to get there

50:00.260 --> 50:03.260
and do the thing.

50:03.260 --> 50:06.260
No, all of us wanted to fly those spaceships

50:06.260 --> 50:08.260
and everybody kind of wanted to be first

50:08.260 --> 50:10.260
because that's competitive way.

50:10.260 --> 50:12.260
But when we weren't, we always were happy.

50:12.260 --> 50:14.260
Even at that point, we feel that way now.

50:14.260 --> 50:15.260
13 was a failure.

50:15.260 --> 50:19.260
And it wasn't until later that people recognized that

50:19.260 --> 50:23.260
that may very well have been one of NASA's finest hours

50:23.260 --> 50:24.260
that we saved that crew.

50:25.260 --> 50:27.260
We, NASA and the crew themselves,

50:27.260 --> 50:33.260
saved that mission and it became a very well known success.

50:33.260 --> 50:36.260
You see Apollo 13 and everybody knows the story.

50:36.260 --> 50:41.260
But at that time, I never reflected in being in between 11 and 13

50:41.260 --> 50:43.260
until it was very moment.

50:43.260 --> 50:46.260
But I still think 12 was the most interesting one

50:46.260 --> 50:52.260
because of the survey or first deployment of the nuclear-powered station

50:52.260 --> 50:53.260
and then the geology.

50:53.260 --> 50:57.260
All other guys did was, nobody got to a surveyor.

50:57.260 --> 51:01.260
And so they had a car to run around in like,

51:01.260 --> 51:03.260
didn't make them like us old fellows.

51:03.260 --> 51:06.260
One of the things that Pete had said,

51:06.260 --> 51:10.260
that served us good all the time we were training and flying,

51:10.260 --> 51:12.260
was we're going to do this job right.

51:12.260 --> 51:14.260
But we're going to have a good time alone the way.

51:14.260 --> 51:17.260
And I felt like we always did do that.

51:17.260 --> 51:21.260
And maybe that's one of the reasons we've been such good friends all the way through there

51:21.260 --> 51:27.260
is he set the tone of doing really good, doing right, but still having fun.

51:27.260 --> 51:29.260
Not just making it so serious.

51:29.260 --> 51:32.260
Well, if you can't be human, it's not worth doing the way I look at it.

51:32.260 --> 51:33.260
Mm-hmm.

51:33.260 --> 51:34.260
Worked out good.

51:34.260 --> 51:35.260
Part of being alive.

51:35.260 --> 51:36.260
Here we are.

51:36.260 --> 51:37.260
Can't be good.

51:37.260 --> 51:38.260
Be cold.

51:38.260 --> 51:39.260
Be cold.

51:39.260 --> 51:40.260
That's another one.

51:42.260 --> 51:48.260
I always feel like nowadays that I won the lottery twice to get to be on the mission

51:48.260 --> 51:54.260
or just to be part of NASA during these periods when we were trying to accomplish an impossible dream.

51:54.260 --> 51:58.260
Not everybody in their professional life gets that kind of challenge.

51:58.260 --> 52:01.260
You know, a lot of people can do it, but they don't have the opportunity.

52:01.260 --> 52:05.260
But we got selected and went there and they said,

52:05.260 --> 52:09.260
you guys are going to find a way to go to the moon and walk around and come back.

52:09.260 --> 52:11.260
We got to be part of that.

52:11.260 --> 52:13.260
And I don't know.

52:13.260 --> 52:14.260
I feel blessed every day.

52:14.260 --> 52:16.260
I feel like every single day.

52:16.260 --> 52:19.260
I just lucked out of all these people on Earth here.

52:19.260 --> 52:21.260
Here we are.

52:21.260 --> 52:31.260
Well, I think I would like to have gone that last 60 miles, but I have to be satisfied with the opportunity I had to fly two missions in the space program.

52:31.260 --> 52:38.260
And I think the thing, and I remember about about Apollo, and I think we universally say this.

52:38.260 --> 52:42.260
We've often been asked what we discovered when we went to the moon.

52:42.260 --> 52:46.260
And we seem to respond that we discovered the Earth.

52:46.260 --> 52:55.260
And I think when you think about it or you look at the pictures or Al's painting, you can see what I mean by that statement.

52:55.260 --> 52:59.260
We discovered the Earth.

52:59.260 --> 53:06.260
Well, along with what Al had to say, I was lucky to fly four.

53:06.260 --> 53:13.260
And I think you guys said it pretty well.

53:13.260 --> 53:16.260
We just like to be real lucky.

53:16.260 --> 53:24.260
10 days after this historic reunion, Pete Conrad was killed in a motorcycle accident near his home in California.

53:24.260 --> 53:28.260
He was 69.

53:28.260 --> 53:32.260
This program is dedicated to the memory of Charles P. Conrad.

53:33.260 --> 53:41.260
His love of flying at his fearless spirit combined to crystallize the image of the astronaut as a true American hero.

53:41.260 --> 53:49.260
He possessed a fierce loyalty to his crewmates, a deep love for his family, and an unmatched devotion to his country.

53:49.260 --> 53:57.260
He will always be remembered for his childlike joy and discovery, unearthed and in the heavens.
