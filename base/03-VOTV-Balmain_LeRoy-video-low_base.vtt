00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This time, about 7.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
19.41.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
A date which will live in infamous.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
We're up in broadcast, bringing us in parking lots

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
and running the United States.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Last, Washington.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Nobody knows that this Japanese attack won for a long time.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
I'm Tom Terbivill.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Leroy Balmain was in boot camp at Catalina Island

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
in August of 1945.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
As a merchant marine, and later in the Air Force,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
he did not see combat duty, but served his country first

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
as a fireman aboard the SS Alfred C. Troupe,

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
and then eventually as an administrative supervisor.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
He and his wife, Marito, were married in 1946,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
and his assignments took them from Alaska to Topeca

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
to Alabama to Washington, D.C.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
to Shreveport to the Philippines,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
and finally back to the States,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
and in 1972 to Bryan,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
where he served four years as an Air Force recruiter.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
After he retired from the service,

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
he spent 19 years as executive director

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
for the Better Business Bureau here.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
So you see his entire adult life has been one of service.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
So please welcome, Leroy Balmain,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
and Leroy Balmain to veterans of the Valley.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Leroy, thank you for being here.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Thank you first for your service.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
I appreciate your service and your long duty in the Air Force.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I know it was an interesting time and interesting time in your life,

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
and obviously one that you're proud of, right?

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
I am most proud of the service that I have given to our country

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
and to our local community.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Exactly.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
It gives you a good warm feeling, you know,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
to do something like that.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Right, right. Well, you know,

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
kids growing up and then graduating from high school

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
in the 40s and around the war and all,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
and that's what they did.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
There was an era of patriotism that went through everybody back then.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Many of my friends, that's what caused me to

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
want to go into the military as young as I was.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Everybody else was going,

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
and I thought I needed to go

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
and help do what I could do.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
And then that's the reason why I went in at the age of 17.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
In 1945, and you entered the merchant Marines.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
I believe you might be the first veteran that I've had on

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
that I know of that was in the merchant Marines.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Talk about that and why you went that route initially.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Okay. I wanted to go into the service,

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
but my parents would not sign the papers for me to go.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
So I finally came up with the merchant Marines

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
and they were convinced in that they would go ahead

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
and sign the papers.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
And I entered the merchant Marines.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Indeed. And like I said in the beginning,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
you were at Catalina Island in boot camp actually

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
when the hostilities ended with the dropping of the bomb

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
in August of 1945.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
So that kind of, I guess,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
changed your direction as far as what you were going to be doing.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
Well, yes, I was already obligated to serve in the merchant Marines

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
when the bomb was dropped.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
So I was at Catalina Island receiving my boot training.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
And from there, I left and went to Japan.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Right. Right.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
The ship that I was on left St. Pedro, California.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
And went down through the Panama Canal up to New Orleans.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
And we loaded the ship with supplies

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
that the military would need over there.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Tanks and trucks and grocerystie,

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
so forth like that.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
So we left New Orleans and went to

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
down through the Panama Canal again.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
And in 49 days later, we arrived in Japan.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
49 days. That's quite a trip.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Quite a roundabout way to get from California to Japan.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Those are New Orleans.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
So ships wouldn't made the go very fast.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Now, I stated that your job was as a fireman.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
That's not the traditional description of the word fireman.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
You kept the boilers going and kept the ship going the right direction.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
We kept the steam up to the maximum.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
So the ship would go as fast as it could.

04:55.000 --> 05:04.000
And my job was to make sure that everything was okay in the engine room.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Right. So that was my job.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
That was your job.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
And this whole experience was quite a deal for a young kid from Hooks, Texas,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
who'd never even seen the water before.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
I mean, there was more water out there than I thought.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
You got an idea there was a lot of them.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Yeah, I had an idea that they was something there, but I didn't realize they were so much.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
You know, because being the first time I'd seen the ocean.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Right. Right.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Now, this was the Alfred C. True was the ship that you were on.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
That was a merchant vessel.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Right.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I tried to find a picture of the Alfred C. True, but I couldn't find a picture of it.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I think you said it's...

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
It was decommissioned and then sold for salvage.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
So it may be something else now.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
So that's a lot.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
It's probably scattered out everywhere by now.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
The ship, though, had a duty in Japan.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
And when you all got there, talk about when you got there.

06:01.000 --> 06:13.000
We arrived in Yokohama, Japan, and then went on down to a place, the name of Curry,

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
T-U-R-E, Japan, is where we unloaded our cargo.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
And then once we were unloaded, we went back to Yokohama.

06:23.000 --> 06:40.000
And that was when they removed a screw members and put a Japanese crew aboard to ferry their people back from the islands back to the mainland.

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
And we came back to the states as passengers on another cargo ship.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
I see.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
That was coming back over here.

06:51.000 --> 07:00.000
That's fascinating how you know we fought the war against the Japanese, but then once the war was over,

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
then we served in sort of helping them get back home as part of the occupation duty.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
That's right.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah, indeed.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Indeed, that is the case.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
So you came back home and from the islands, March of 1946, and you went back to Hookstexis, right?

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
We went back to Hookstexis, and visited with my family for a while.

07:21.000 --> 07:29.000
And then the draft board told me that they was going to draft me, then they were drafting at the age of 18.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
And I just couldn't imagine getting drafted, you know.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
So I beat them to it.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
I went down and joined.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
And we swore into the Air Force on August 3rd, 1946.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
1946.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
It was the Army Air Corps.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Army Air Corps.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Were the brown shoes back then, you know.

07:54.000 --> 08:02.000
And it was not the Air Force until later on in 1947.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Why the Air Force?

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Did you have initial designs on being a flyer or being in the air?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Really looking for maintenance or what were you looking for?

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
I was looking for a job in supply or something like that, you know.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Well, I went to the Army Air Corps route.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Right.

08:23.000 --> 08:32.000
And I got in there and then it became a separate service and I received training in something else.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
And then I pursued that, you know.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
And indeed, 22 years you were in the Air Force and we'll talk about that career.

08:41.000 --> 08:49.000
After basic, you were sent to Fort Scott or Scott Air Force Base in Illinois as a telephone lineman.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Yes.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Climbing poles, stringing the wires for it.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
And it's a long way up those poles too.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
It's a lot faster coming down and it is going up.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
But you didn't have designs on climate poles.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
No, I didn't.

09:09.000 --> 09:21.000
When they called me in and said Alaska was my choice of a station to go to overseas.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
You know, basic and tech training.

09:25.000 --> 09:33.000
So I went to, was assigned to Alaska and they called me in.

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
And I told them that I was one of the best type to say they'd ever seen.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
And that way I got into typing career.

09:47.000 --> 09:55.000
And I knew that they'd have to have that typewriter in a warm place, you know, for it to operate.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Right.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
And if you were to hear the typewriter, why was the operator?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I wanted to be warm.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
And you told them you were an expert typewriter because you'd taken six weeks of typing.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
I said, I had six weeks.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Well, I made you an expert.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
And they didn't need pole climbers in Alaska.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
No, they didn't need pole climbers.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
They needed to clerk typists.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
So you were clerk typists at the time it was lab Air Force Air Base in Alaska.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
In Alaska.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Air banks in Alaska.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
I see.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Which is Fort Wayne right up.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Fort Wayne right now.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
To tell me now.

10:31.000 --> 10:39.000
And the mission of that group up there was flying weather missions over the, tell us about that mission.

10:39.000 --> 10:49.000
Well, it was, we flew between the lines and it was weather missions up over the North Pole.

10:49.000 --> 10:58.000
And I have to leave the engines going long time to keep them from freezing up, you know.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Right.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Well, that was a very, very interesting too.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Right.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Right.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Now you've been married in 1946 in December of 1946.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
And after a while that you were in Alaska, your wife, Marito, was able to join you there.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
That's right.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Yes, that's right.

11:14.000 --> 11:24.000
She came up and joined me and got a job working on the, on the base as, in the weather office as a, as a secretary.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
I see.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
And worked there for a couple of years, you know, or a year and a half to shoot was up there.

11:30.000 --> 11:37.000
Matter of fact, we have a picture right now of, there is the, the young, Lee Roy and Marito.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
And we were, we were 18 years old when that picture was taken.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Wow.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
And we're still together.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
How about that?

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Well, 60 years, 1946, 62 years.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Or, or, or 64 years.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
64 years.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Well, what a, what a wonderful story.

11:58.000 --> 12:09.000
And then you were fortunate in that you were able to serve your entire 22 years just about the whole time with you all together because she was able to follow you from assignment to assignment.

12:10.000 --> 12:21.000
We, I can't remember a time that we did not travel at the same time to another base, right?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
In, in all the time that we were in.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Right.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Right.

12:25.000 --> 12:33.000
To pick your Kansas Forbes Air Force Base and that's where you were, you were discharged in 1946 before you, you re-elisted.

12:33.000 --> 12:42.000
August 3rd, 1946, I was discharged at Forbes Air Force Base in Topeka, Kansas.

12:42.000 --> 12:59.000
And we came to Hooks and visited our families for a few days and went on to Montgomery, Alabama and re-enlisted in the Air Force at Maxwell Air Force Base.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
Now, was that a decision that you all had already always made that you were going to re-enlist or was, or were you thinking about staying retired?

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
We were, we were, we left open both ways, you know.

13:12.000 --> 13:20.000
We didn't know whether we would get work in civilian life or are staying the most there.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Right.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
We enjoyed our first three years so we decided we'd try it again.

13:27.000 --> 13:37.000
And we re-enlisted at Maxwell and from there on it was working on my 20 years.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Exactly, exactly.

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
Two, three years at Maxwell, wing inspector.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Uh-huh.

13:46.000 --> 14:01.000
I was with the wing inspector's office and it was our responsibility to, to inspect organizations to make sure that they were operating under the proper orders and technical orders and so forth.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Right.

14:02.000 --> 14:12.000
And that was, my job was to make sure all the technical orders were up to date and so forth like that.

14:12.000 --> 14:21.000
Then your next assignment was Washington, DC and the Air Force Officers Program and Atomic Energy. What can you tell us about that?

14:21.000 --> 14:29.000
Air Force Office for Atomic Energy, I worked for a civilian who has passed away now.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
Dr. William D. Ernie, I worked for him.

14:33.000 --> 14:40.000
And that was a job that lasted, I guess, about two or three years.

14:40.000 --> 14:52.000
And we, I cannot go in detail on some of my...

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
That's what's called a special assignment.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah, it's a special assignment.

14:56.000 --> 15:04.000
You noted that in your 22 years service of the Air Force, you didn't, the majority of that, you actually were not on a military base, right?

15:04.000 --> 15:12.000
And in my 22 years, I was, I was only on a naval force base for 10 years, for 10 years.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Right, right.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
Including your last assignment here in Brian, which we'll talk about in a minute.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
Left Washington in 1950 and then the Shreveport, Louisiana, which wasn't far from home in Hookstex, is it?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Very close to home.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
I was assigned to...

15:30.000 --> 15:51.000
Bozer Base as an administrative specialist and worked in the plant where we worked on the material that we were charged with.

15:51.000 --> 15:59.000
And that lasted, like, four, five years, I guess.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Five years?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
And then from Shreveport, Louisiana, to the Philippines.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
To the Philippines.

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
And I noted that you didn't serve in combat, but you must have felt that way when you were flying to the Philippines.

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
Tell that story about the flight because you were with Marita and your two young children at the time.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
I think you said Gary was nine and Debbie was five.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
And talk about the flight to the Philippines.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Okay, we went by way of Hawaii.

16:25.000 --> 16:37.000
And of course, our daughter got air sick in Hawaii and her mother had to take her in and clean her all up, you know.

16:37.000 --> 16:44.000
We got closer to Guam, or was our next stop, and the plane was on fire.

16:44.000 --> 16:51.000
And you could see a flame coming out of the engine.

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
And we were beginning to land.

16:57.000 --> 17:04.000
And here come all of the ambulances and fire engines and so forth like that, you know.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
And scared a bunch of people a little bit.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
A little bit.

17:11.000 --> 17:19.000
We got off that plane, got on another one, and started on into Guam.

17:19.000 --> 17:26.000
And the plane lost an engine, and we had the jets and the fuel and come back into Guam.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
This was the second plane.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
It lost an engine.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Then we...

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Did you think about taking a boat then?

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
We were looking closer at a boat.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Another motor transportation.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Yeah, it couldn't drive.

17:43.000 --> 17:51.000
But we came in and they had a campus overnight.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Right.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
And during the night, they fixed the original plane that we had come in on.

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
So the next morning we got back on that plane with all of our luggage and stuff.

18:05.000 --> 18:17.000
We had to tow it around and we flew on into the Philippines and landed at Clark Air Base the next day.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Now you were assigned to the Air Act Shay office there, and it was really...

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
You didn't wear uniform in this position.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Talk a little bit about your job.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
So that was interesting.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
You were a lay-us-out between the US Air Force and the Philippines Air Force.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
That's correct.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
That was our job.

18:32.000 --> 18:45.000
And again, my position was as the administrative supervisor for the Air Act Shay office.

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
And we started for a little over three years on that assignment.

18:52.000 --> 19:04.000
And children became acquainted with what an embassy is.

19:04.000 --> 19:11.000
A lot of people don't get that chance to serve in an embassy.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Right.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
But they learned a lot.

19:15.000 --> 19:22.000
And I think my son just commented the other day of how much he remembered about it.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Right. Right. Well, you went over there. He was 9, I guess you left.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
He was 12, so he would remember a lot.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
And even Debbie, as young as she was, she went over to college.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Debbie and I had lunch together today.

19:32.000 --> 19:44.000
And she was telling me some of the things that she had remembered, such as the school building had been used as a prison for some of the people.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
During the Japanese occupation.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Right. Right. Right.

19:50.000 --> 20:01.000
You left the Philippines in, I guess, the late 50s, early 60s went to Dayton, Ohio for an assignment there with strategic air command.

20:01.000 --> 20:08.000
Right. Right.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Right. Right. Right.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Patterson. Right. Patterson Air Force Base.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
And we served there for a tour of duty.

20:17.000 --> 20:28.000
And with the bomb squadron of B-52, KC-139.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
I see. I see.

20:29.000 --> 20:41.000
And then we left there and I came to school at Laxman Air Force Base for recruiting duty.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Right.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
And they trained me to be a recruiter.

20:45.000 --> 20:57.000
And then I served, we had six counties that we were responsible for.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Right. You were assigned to Brian.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
But my duty station was here in Brian. That's where I lived.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
And I think you said your office was actually in downtown Brian, where the federal building is now, in the post office.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
Where the federal building, we were, we had the building downstairs.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Right.

21:16.000 --> 21:25.000
And several times we've, you hear people running down the steps, you know,

21:25.000 --> 21:35.000
and they'd come in and asked to be enlisted into the military.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Uh-huh.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Talk about, talk more about that duty because this was the time in the early 60s.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Vietnam was, was going then.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Lyndon Johnson was in office.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
Vietnam was, was really the, the, the hot spot.

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
And you were here at a college town to talk about the, the challenges of recruiting there.

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
You said it was one of the most difficult jobs that, that you had because of the, the quotas you were required to.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
It, it, it, it was a difficult job.

22:03.000 --> 22:12.000
And, and a lot of the guys could not, could not take it, you know, a lot of pressure on somebody.

22:12.000 --> 22:22.000
And, you know, you know, you were given a, a quota of, of, uh, what, we were responsible for nurses and, and, uh,

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
special type of, uh, women, women, air force.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Uh-huh.

22:27.000 --> 22:34.000
You get a quota for a woman and, and, and, uh, they're not, they don't go in as much as the men do, you know.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Right.

22:35.000 --> 22:45.000
And, uh, you know, you have to get, uh, to get to get to get your sign, uh, if, if you have a, a woman, or if you have a nurse or something like that, you know.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Right.

22:46.000 --> 23:01.000
And, uh, but, uh, out of the, the three years that, that I was only recruiting due to, I was fortunate enough to be number three in Air Force, uh, all three years that I was, was going with.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Right.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Number three in the country.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
So you were obviously pretty good at it.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
And that being here in what, at, at that time was certainly a rural area.

23:09.000 --> 23:21.000
You had a very rural, very rural and, uh, but, uh, when the draft is looking at you, you know, and it's, uh,

23:21.000 --> 23:27.000
uh, had hips and makeup for their mind, uh, easier, you know, and, yeah, yeah.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
I guess so, uh, you retired in 1968 from the service after 22 years.

23:32.000 --> 23:40.000
Uh, you went to Lufkin for four years in the insurance business, but then you came back to Brian in February of 1972.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
You took over as executive director of the Better Business Bureau and stayed there for 19 years.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
And that was, uh, that was an interesting, interesting job, obviously.

23:49.000 --> 23:56.000
Very interesting, uh, being a new, a new bureau.

23:56.000 --> 24:07.000
Uh, I, uh, had heard about the job from, uh, the guy that run, uh, the Chamber of Commerce.

24:07.000 --> 24:22.000
And, uh, I applied for the, for the job and was, uh, was hired to, uh, to, uh, be the executive director for the next 19 years, you know.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Right, right.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
And the, the nature of the job was very similar to it.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
It is now.

24:27.000 --> 24:34.000
You were looking out for, for businesses and for the consumer and people that wanted to take your money for, for not good reasons.

24:34.000 --> 24:40.000
And, uh, so it was essentially the, the same kind of thing that they're, they're doing now.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
That's right.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
They're still doing this and they'll be doing it next year.

24:45.000 --> 24:55.000
In fact, I believe you told me that, uh, that you used to go on radio stations and TV stations and, and report about, uh, you know, people to look out for and, yeah.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
And, and things like that.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
You said that you'd even been in this studio before.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I was in this studio.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
Uh, Mrs. Colson was that sharing Colson.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
She still does.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I've been on her program.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
The magazine show here at KAMU.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Yeah.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
A long time ago.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
Time goes by and, or you were hearing your capacity is, uh, with a better business bureau.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
That's, uh, that's past, past, past, and you retired in 1989.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
1989.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
1989.

25:24.000 --> 25:33.000
I know that you've been retired and, and I know you're very active now in the, uh, with the American Legion and, uh, and other groups and, and things like that.

25:33.000 --> 25:39.000
So you and, you and, and, uh, you like you and, Maria, like to stay busy.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
We do.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
Uh, but we're beginning to slow down.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
You know, after, uh, once you get in your age, you begin to slow down a little bit.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Right.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Talk about your family.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
You all, you have a son, as we mentioned.

25:52.000 --> 26:00.000
A son who is, is employed by the city of college station.

26:00.000 --> 26:08.000
As the, he's superintendent of the roads and drainage, uh, of the city.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
And, uh, then our daughter is a school teacher.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Mm-hmm.

26:13.000 --> 26:19.000
And, uh, has retired once, but, uh, is back teaching again now.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
So wonderful.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Wonderful.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
I think you said you had four grandkids.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
I have four grandchildren.

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
One of them, by the way, is, uh, a graduate of Texas A&M.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
He's, uh, a mechanical engineer with, with NASA.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Wow.

26:36.000 --> 26:43.000
Uh, we have, uh, another, our other grandson has got 14 years in the Air Force.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
He's, uh, he's a career man.

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
And, uh, then I have a granddaughter that's a school teacher here.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
She's that bilingual teacher, bilingual.

26:55.000 --> 27:06.000
And then our other little granddaughter who is, uh, is a downs, lives, uh, a down home ranch in, in Elgin.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
I see.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
And, uh, that's my four grandchildren.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
All of which you.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
And then I got some great grandchildren.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
I wish we had time to go into them, but, uh, when they grow up, we'll talk about their careers and all that.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Leroy, thank you very much for your service.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And thank you for, for being with us.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
It's a fascinating career.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Pleasure.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
We appreciate you.

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
Leroy Balmain's generation was one where service just came naturally, as did patriotism.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
Leaving home and joining the military was just something that young kids did.

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
When you got out of high school in the 1940s, Leroy Balmain joined when he was 17 out of Hooks, Texas.

27:42.000 --> 27:48.000
We salute him for his long service in the Air Force, in the infernarily two decades of his service to his community.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I'm Tom Turbiville.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
Be sure and join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

28:12.000 --> 28:22.000
Thanks for watching.
