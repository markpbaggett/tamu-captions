00:27.000 --> 00:29.500
Hello, and welcome to Veterans of the Valley!

00:29.500 --> 00:31.840
I'm Tom Terbivill.

00:31.840 --> 00:34.240
You won't find a Prouder, Aggie, and Joe Brewster.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.980
Being an Aggie is in his blood.

00:35.980 --> 00:41.580
His father, his grandfather, his great uncle, his uncle, his sons, all fellow Aggies.

00:41.580 --> 00:46.680
And like his father, Colonel Olin Finley Brewster, Joe Brewster served his country in combat.

00:46.680 --> 00:50.760
Olin Brewster, a decorated soldier of the Battle of the Volts in World War II.

00:50.760 --> 00:55.500
Joe Brewster, a ground infantry fighter in the jungles of Vietnam and Cambodia.

00:55.500 --> 00:59.940
It's our pleasure to have Lieutenant Joe Brewster as our guest on Veterans of the Valley.

00:59.940 --> 01:01.460
Joe, it's great to have you here.

01:01.460 --> 01:05.680
First, I want you to talk about Olin Finley Brewster, your dad.

01:05.680 --> 01:09.600
I know you told me one time that there were probably not many officers that were more

01:09.600 --> 01:12.320
written about in World War II than Olin Brewster.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.720
Talk about your dad and what he did.

01:13.720 --> 01:17.220
Well, my dad was a major.

01:17.220 --> 01:21.680
His promise came about in the Battle of the Volts.

01:21.680 --> 01:27.160
Very much to Germany's Triter Counter Fenceype in December of 1944.

01:27.160 --> 01:30.560
Trying to split the American Allied Forces, get the Antwerp.

01:30.560 --> 01:35.720
And for this assessed, they had to go through several major road intersections.

01:35.720 --> 01:43.620
And my dad was responsible for an area south of Antwerp, area called Parker's Crossroads.

01:43.620 --> 01:46.760
And they held this intersection for two or three days, keeping the German divisions

01:46.760 --> 01:47.760
back.

01:47.920 --> 01:52.880
But being right in the middle of a core boundary, one core unit pulled back to reset their lines.

01:52.880 --> 01:56.600
The other core unit did not, which my dad was still left forward.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.240
And the only reason he had to pull that was the Germans got in and around behind him.

02:00.240 --> 02:04.280
So he was given the orders to pull back the best way he could.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.200
Pulling forward, he lost several tanks.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.320
Pulling backwards, he lost several tanks.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.480
And he realized that point in time that he wouldn't be able to give men out successfully

02:11.480 --> 02:16.320
unless they wanted to destroy the rest of their vehicles.

02:16.640 --> 02:21.920
He was able to march all his men out on Christmas Eve there in December 1944.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.680
And it was a story that you're very proud of and you're very proud of him.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.800
And how you lost him not too many years ago.

02:26.800 --> 02:32.440
But he was a person who you were very interested in his service and he and yours.

02:32.440 --> 02:35.880
Well, he brought us kids up, understanding two things.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.520
And number one, we're going to be Aggies.

02:37.520 --> 02:38.520
Right.

02:38.520 --> 02:42.280
We end up, my brother and I end up being third generation Aggies, come through in him.

02:42.280 --> 02:45.240
And he also told us that we had an obligation to our country.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.880
And we would be soldiers.

02:46.880 --> 02:52.280
And my brother just retired, full kernel, stationed down at Fort Sam down in San

02:52.280 --> 02:53.280
Town.

02:53.280 --> 02:59.080
My military career didn't last as long as my dad's and my brothers after spending a couple

02:59.080 --> 03:05.080
years in an active army and then a couple years, two or three years in inactive reserves.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.920
My service came to an end.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.120
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it.

03:10.120 --> 03:13.640
But my dad pretty much set the pattern which us boys had to follow.

03:13.640 --> 03:18.080
Let's talk about the path that brought you not only to ANM but then into the service.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.120
It was a little bit unusual back in the mid 60s when you came to ANM.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.800
There was a brand new program then that still exists today.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.840
Talk about sort of the program that sent you through and to the military at ANM.

03:28.840 --> 03:33.680
Well, my brother was already here at ANM being class of 66.

03:33.680 --> 03:38.360
And it was my turn to come to ANM, but my freshman year I didn't quite have the monies

03:38.360 --> 03:42.640
to come to the fine university here on the brothers.

03:42.640 --> 03:47.040
So I ended up spending a couple years at Temple Junior College over in Temple.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.400
At that time I thought my dream of getting into core here at ANM had come to an end, but

03:50.400 --> 03:54.160
ANM started this new program called Two Year Program where you could go to a summer

03:54.160 --> 03:58.520
camp between your sophomore and junior year in college.

03:58.520 --> 04:03.680
And then you come as a junior in the core, but naturally with freshman privileges.

04:03.680 --> 04:07.680
And then you go to a second summer camp between your junior and senior year.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.960
And so because of this it enabled me to go ahead and get my commission at Texas Indian

04:11.960 --> 04:15.080
University in a two year timeframe, still the four year timeframe.

04:15.080 --> 04:20.680
And you were a distinguished military student here at Texas A&M, is that right?

04:20.680 --> 04:21.800
Yes, sir, that's correct.

04:21.800 --> 04:26.600
And I believe what system in that is, like I say, being a third generation Aggie, I knew

04:26.600 --> 04:31.640
a lot about NM, I knew a lot about the core, I knew what was expected of me.

04:31.640 --> 04:35.080
Also, my dad being the military, I had gone out to Fort Hood with him on numerous occasions

04:35.080 --> 04:37.920
as a kid, so understood the military ways.

04:37.920 --> 04:44.920
The first camp I went to between my sophomore and junior year taught me basic military,

04:44.920 --> 04:49.040
not only to be able to march, to be able to fire a weapon.

04:49.040 --> 04:53.360
I did things prior to coming in my junior year that a lot of juniors in the core had not

04:53.360 --> 04:54.840
got to do yet.

04:54.840 --> 04:59.600
So when it came time to teach in dismounted drill and doing things with weapons, I was often

04:59.600 --> 05:01.800
used as an instructor.

05:01.800 --> 05:06.400
Then between my junior and senior year, I excelled at Fort Silocahoma.

05:06.400 --> 05:11.000
And so that gave me an opportunity to be nominated for and receive this DMS and later DMG.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.560
It also gave you the opportunity to choose your specialty in the Army, or at least narrow

05:15.560 --> 05:16.560
it down.

05:16.560 --> 05:21.520
And I know you said you put down infantry armoured in artillery and you got infantry,

05:21.520 --> 05:22.520
is that right?

05:22.520 --> 05:27.000
Well, back then you were required to put one combat branch, which would have been

05:27.000 --> 05:29.280
armored or infantry artillery.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.960
Then you put down two service branches, a quarter master of transportation.

05:32.960 --> 05:37.560
I was a little gung-hole side back then, so I wanted to go combat, so I put them down

05:37.560 --> 05:39.080
infantry armoured in artillery.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.280
I broke my dad's heart because he was armoured.

05:41.280 --> 05:45.280
But I knew that I wanted to go infantry because Vietnam was going at the time.

05:45.280 --> 05:49.760
And I couldn't see fighting in the jungles of Vietnam sitting in a half track or a tank.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.400
I thought my chances were a lot better than infantrymen.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.880
And so that's the way I selected an army based on a great wisdom gave it to me.

05:55.880 --> 05:56.880
When did you range your school?

05:56.880 --> 05:57.880
I'll talk about that.

05:57.880 --> 05:58.880
Oh, love range of school.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.240
I knew that when I came through, I was basically at Fort Benning.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.640
But again, my path was towards Vietnam.

06:05.640 --> 06:08.880
And I felt like the best insurers policy to have at time is to take some of the better

06:08.880 --> 06:10.960
schools that the army was offering.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.880
I did the airborne jump school.

06:13.880 --> 06:17.640
It was great for just getting out and running every morning and jumping out of an airplane,

06:17.640 --> 06:20.160
but I couldn't see its full usefulness in Vietnam.

06:20.160 --> 06:23.600
But the range of school taught small unit tactics.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.520
And it taught you what was like to fight in jungle where you were spent two weeks in

06:26.520 --> 06:29.120
the Atlantic of Georgia doing mountain warfare.

06:29.120 --> 06:33.400
And then they took us down to Algonair Force Base to jungles down in Florida.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.000
And we spent two and a half weeks of maneuvering down there.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.440
And that gave me a really good experience of what I could expect when I got to Vietnam.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.240
You went to Fort Riley, Kansas for three months.

06:43.240 --> 06:47.400
I guess for your final training before you went in country.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.880
1970, I guess this was toward the latter years actually of the war.

06:50.880 --> 06:57.600
1970, our first or second week of January, you were in country and you served for 11 months.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.280
I was going to talk about when you first went there.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.920
I'm going to let you just sort of go ahead and sort of talk about your 11 months in service

07:03.920 --> 07:04.920
in Vietnam.

07:04.920 --> 07:09.160
I know you talk about that you had a guardian angel on you many times.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.760
So just go with it and talk about your service in Vietnam.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.720
Well, one thing that I found out real quickly in Vietnam is it doesn't matter how good you

07:16.720 --> 07:17.720
are.

07:17.720 --> 07:21.360
A lot of it to turn on the zone, how lucky you can also be.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.680
And I often refer to it as being the guardian angel.

07:23.680 --> 07:28.240
My first day out in the field, I was flown out with another lieutenant who was also being

07:28.240 --> 07:31.160
assigned to the same battalion I was being assigned to.

07:31.160 --> 07:35.600
And also in helicopter was a full colonel who happened to also be a press routine minister.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.560
So I felt like if you had to go into combat, that was probably the best person to go in

07:38.560 --> 07:39.560
with.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.880
As I exited the helicopter at my first forward base, there was an officer waiting for me

07:43.880 --> 07:45.600
out on the pad.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.000
And I thought that was my welcome committee.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.280
Well, I found out that was the lieutenant who's place I was taking.

07:50.280 --> 07:55.600
I thought and was an understanding that I would work with him up to a week to get a better

07:55.600 --> 08:02.480
grasp of what to expect of my troops in my platoon as well as the area of operation we'd

08:02.480 --> 08:03.480
be working in.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.960
Well, he let me know immediately as he was boarding the helicopter that he thought his luck

08:06.960 --> 08:11.720
had run out and he was going back to the rear base and I was on my own.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.800
My dad had always told me that look to your in-seos.

08:14.800 --> 08:19.760
They are the backbone of the army and thank goodness my platoon had a crusty O in-seo.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.960
He said, and he took me under his wing and he said, lieutenant, if you listen to me,

08:23.960 --> 08:25.680
I can get you through this.

08:25.680 --> 08:29.800
And so for the first two or three weeks, I pretty much listened to him and I felt like

08:29.800 --> 08:32.960
that a lot of my success came from him.

08:32.960 --> 08:37.880
But I was thrown into it almost immediately after meeting my company commander and was

08:37.880 --> 08:40.040
introduced to my platoon and met a lot of the platoon members.

08:40.040 --> 08:45.720
We were out the second night I was in country and we had river boats that the Navy provided

08:45.720 --> 08:46.720
us to take us up.

08:46.720 --> 08:50.360
We were forming an umbrella protection for Saigon.

08:50.360 --> 08:55.160
We were trying to interdict both forces as well as supplies coming in from Cambodia by

08:55.160 --> 08:58.320
either water routes or trail jungle trails.

08:58.320 --> 09:03.240
And so we were supposed to interdict them by setting up ambushes at night and preventing

09:03.240 --> 09:06.440
them from moving through the area freely.

09:06.440 --> 09:10.520
My first night we were set up and normally you set up either a linear ambush with rear

09:10.520 --> 09:15.840
security or an L-shaped ambush with rear security, pinned on the train and what you're

09:15.840 --> 09:17.800
trying to ambush a trail or water wipe.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.880
As we got in late though, we did not have an opportunity to check out the trains.

09:21.880 --> 09:26.880
We just formed a wagon wheel type of ambush, figured it would be in direction 360, we'd

09:26.880 --> 09:28.400
be ready for it.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.040
After about an hour on the ground, I didn't have an hour on the ground.

09:30.040 --> 09:37.440
I was tapped by one of the members of my units saying they're out there and I said who's

09:37.440 --> 09:38.440
out there?

09:38.440 --> 09:42.800
He informed me that it sounded like VCU and VIA had found our position and he suggested

09:42.800 --> 09:44.800
we go full alert.

09:44.800 --> 09:49.480
And by that time our RTO also punched me and said lieutenant, the train sergeant on the

09:49.480 --> 09:53.200
side of the ambush says that he has movement out in front of him.

09:53.200 --> 09:57.560
So I called my, and Cion said, hey, this is my first night out here, what do you recommend?

09:57.560 --> 09:59.640
He said well, go to a full, a mad minute.

09:59.640 --> 10:04.860
Which meant that everybody in our ambush would fire immediately at the same time for one

10:04.860 --> 10:06.080
full minute.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.480
Which we did.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.120
And sure enough, the NVAVC, we're out in front of us.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.920
We received return fire.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.760
We suffered four or five casualties at that time.

10:14.760 --> 10:21.200
We ourselves only found a few blood trails of the, of the NVAVC had no KIA that we could

10:21.200 --> 10:22.200
count for.

10:22.200 --> 10:26.960
Since it was so late at night, since we could not move to another position successfully

10:26.960 --> 10:31.960
and safely, we were extracted that night and then we continued to do the same routine over

10:31.960 --> 10:33.960
the next couple of weeks.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.600
The mad minutes.

10:35.600 --> 10:40.640
This is your first really full night in command of the platoon.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.800
And how did you feel?

10:42.800 --> 10:47.960
I mean, it must have been rather mind boggling for you to realize where you were and that

10:47.960 --> 10:49.840
this was the real thing.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.720
It's amazing how with all the training that I had done both through, actually all for

10:53.720 --> 11:00.160
basic, Ranger and Airborne, that immediately when the first rounds were fired, that I was

11:00.160 --> 11:02.440
even aware of what I was doing.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.560
There was a mechanism kicked in.

11:04.560 --> 11:08.960
My infantry platoon leader just said, quote, this is how it's done.

11:08.960 --> 11:13.320
You have studied it over and over again, follow your intuition.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.160
Your training will not take you the wrong direction.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.960
And I noticed that throughout my nine or ten months out of the field that every time a

11:19.960 --> 11:25.520
situation occurred, I'd fall back on that training and a training was always successful.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.280
It worked.

11:28.280 --> 11:34.360
You talked to me earlier about that these troops in Vietnam, sometimes that they had to endure

11:34.360 --> 11:38.300
for lack of a better word, several different leaders during a year because the officers

11:38.300 --> 11:41.900
were moved in and moved out of Vietnam, they might get three or four.

11:41.900 --> 11:45.840
So you were placed in that situation to where you were a brand new leader for troops that

11:45.840 --> 11:47.620
had been there, maybe a couple of tours.

11:47.620 --> 11:52.100
So I heard it talk about that and what that was like in the help that you got sort of being

11:52.100 --> 11:53.580
placed in that situation.

11:53.580 --> 11:59.940
Well, it seemed that part of being in Vietnam was to stop communism, but it was also a training

11:59.940 --> 12:02.220
base for our young soldiers.

12:02.220 --> 12:08.100
The two leaders, the first and second lieutenant's as well as the captains, was in a testing area.

12:08.100 --> 12:12.660
They all, our majority of them were planning on making the Army, regular Army.

12:12.660 --> 12:15.820
And they were all preparing for that big war that at some time in the future we thought

12:15.820 --> 12:18.100
we might have with either China or Russia.

12:18.100 --> 12:23.340
So they were trying to give as many young officers a chance to be in command.

12:23.340 --> 12:27.860
So when I got in country, most of the officers were being rotated out in three or four months.

12:27.860 --> 12:31.620
But Nixon in 1970 said, hey, we're going to start with drawn troops.

12:31.620 --> 12:32.740
So a few and a few of the troops were going.

12:32.740 --> 12:36.340
So instead of me spending the normal three or four months online, I ended up spending

12:36.340 --> 12:37.340
nine.

12:38.140 --> 12:43.340
Problem with this rotation, everything is that you have an entry between a 40 or 45 men.

12:43.340 --> 12:46.220
You have an officer who comes in there and only spends three months.

12:46.220 --> 12:49.540
And he may be a West Point graduate.

12:49.540 --> 12:52.380
And that particular officer has his own way of doing things.

12:52.380 --> 12:55.820
After three months, he would be moved to the rear or to another position.

12:55.820 --> 13:00.500
And you might get an officer coming in for who graduated from Arkansas ROTC, our Texas

13:00.500 --> 13:01.860
Indian University.

13:01.860 --> 13:03.780
Each one wanted to do it their way.

13:03.780 --> 13:09.540
And each time the Bertune had to suffer through this gradual learning again.

13:09.540 --> 13:13.420
Well, the only common base we had was the NCOs.

13:13.420 --> 13:17.820
And that if they had been in military long enough, and if you normally had an EF67, they'd

13:17.820 --> 13:20.140
been in military probably five to ten years.

13:20.140 --> 13:22.780
So they were the constant that went with each Bertune.

13:22.780 --> 13:26.820
They would take the lieutenant in the side and said, that will work if your back-state

13:26.820 --> 13:29.220
side is not going to work here lieutenant.

13:29.220 --> 13:32.060
And if you had a good lieutenant, he would listen to him.

13:32.060 --> 13:38.220
And pretty much that's how we handled our situation for the first two months, one month, until

13:38.220 --> 13:39.220
I got my feet on the ground.

13:39.220 --> 13:42.140
And after that, the constant was made.

13:42.140 --> 13:45.900
And being allowed to stay with my unit for up to eight or nine months, it benefited our

13:45.900 --> 13:46.900
unit.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.700
We were more cohesive during the nine or ten months.

13:49.700 --> 13:50.700
I was in the field.

13:50.700 --> 13:54.620
A lot of the casualties that occurred in Vietnam occurred from baby traps.

13:54.620 --> 13:57.780
We got out in the field and we moved through jungles.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.180
We moved through water areas.

13:59.180 --> 14:01.500
We moved through Michelin River Plantation.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.140
One thing we did, we moved with stealth.

14:03.140 --> 14:06.340
We moved, we didn't go anywhere unless we took our time.

14:06.340 --> 14:10.740
We paid attention to the environment around us.

14:10.740 --> 14:13.540
We would move, we would stop, we would listen, we would smell.

14:13.540 --> 14:16.940
They would move and do the same thing over and over again every fifteen minutes.

14:16.940 --> 14:20.580
And if you let your troops know what you're going to do that day, a lot of the units failed

14:20.580 --> 14:25.340
to tell the private or the point man, hey, this is our objective for the day.

14:25.340 --> 14:29.660
We just said go in that direction for about two thousand to three thousand meters and then

14:29.660 --> 14:31.220
we're going to ambush tonight.

14:31.220 --> 14:33.460
I would try to make sure that down to my lowest man.

14:33.460 --> 14:35.100
They knew what we're going to do that day.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.860
They felt like we were part of the decision making.

14:37.860 --> 14:42.500
And so that if in fact we hit anything along our way from point A to point B, they would

14:42.500 --> 14:44.060
say it was expected.

14:44.060 --> 14:47.220
I was told by the lieutenant that this is what to expect.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.460
And they were more educated when it came to grasping the situation.

14:50.460 --> 14:52.580
Lieutenant Bruce, you brought some pictures.

14:52.580 --> 14:56.180
You have a lot of photographs from your time in Vietnam.

14:56.180 --> 15:00.420
We're going to show some of them here as a matter of fact that Lieutenant Bruce, your

15:00.420 --> 15:01.420
has.

15:01.420 --> 15:02.420
Go ahead and talk about the picture.

15:02.420 --> 15:03.420
What are we looking at there?

15:03.420 --> 15:05.420
Well, this is a road from Contain.

15:05.420 --> 15:06.420
That's you on the right.

15:06.420 --> 15:08.860
That is me on the far right.

15:08.860 --> 15:14.740
And we are pulling a road security for trucks coming from Contain over to the Cambodian

15:14.740 --> 15:16.220
border.

15:16.220 --> 15:23.780
So our job was to parallel this road and make sure the NVC or the NVA and the VECOM were

15:23.780 --> 15:26.940
not sent up ambushes or put mines out in the road.

15:26.940 --> 15:28.380
So this is sort of a rest break.

15:28.380 --> 15:31.380
We had probably been moving since five in the morning.

15:31.380 --> 15:35.100
We stopped probably getting ready to take a lunch break and then move on down the road.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.660
There'd probably be another unit probably a half mile behind us doing the same thing to

15:38.660 --> 15:43.860
keep the NVVC from coming in behind my unit and plant mines before the truck start bringing

15:43.860 --> 15:46.540
in their supplies to the fire support base.

15:46.540 --> 15:49.180
Let's move on to the next one.

15:49.180 --> 15:50.340
Show a little muscle there.

15:50.340 --> 15:54.380
There's a little muscle here but we're having an officers meeting here.

15:54.380 --> 16:03.060
We're getting ready to head out on the choppers out into the jungle and those are the lieutenants

16:03.060 --> 16:07.100
and our company commander had just given us our operation orders.

16:07.100 --> 16:10.740
And typically us officers would, after the company commander left, us lieutenants would

16:10.740 --> 16:15.340
sort of put our heads together and we'd discuss the operation and if anybody had any great

16:15.340 --> 16:19.660
ideas or expectations of what we should know, the most experienced officer would say,

16:19.660 --> 16:21.420
look, we've been in this area before.

16:21.420 --> 16:25.060
We're going back to it again and this is what you need to know about it.

16:25.060 --> 16:28.260
And so we're just discussing what we're getting ready to do for the next two or three days.

16:28.260 --> 16:29.300
Lieutenant Brewster there in the middle.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.500
Let's move on to the next photograph.

16:31.500 --> 16:35.140
Now you're having some fun with some of the kids there and being not.

16:35.140 --> 16:40.700
You know, there was a, we were pretty much day in day out in the jungles working ambushes

16:41.420 --> 16:46.420
but every once in a while we had the enjoyment of getting to pull protection for a village.

16:46.420 --> 16:49.740
And we enjoyed working with the village people and they enjoyed us.

16:49.740 --> 16:53.860
Typically we would have, in our company of three buttoons, we'd have two buttoons full

16:53.860 --> 16:58.900
in umbrella security on the outside of the village and one of the buttoons would stay inside

16:58.900 --> 17:04.180
the village and help maybe build buildings, build desks for the small kids.

17:04.180 --> 17:07.420
We provided entertainment for them and here we're just taking the opportunity to let the

17:07.420 --> 17:09.420
kids know that we were friendly.

17:09.460 --> 17:10.540
We were easy going.

17:10.540 --> 17:14.620
We were not big giants who were going to hurt them.

17:14.620 --> 17:18.780
And so we're doing a game of splits here and the kids found it very entertaining.

17:18.780 --> 17:21.500
That's you in the back there doing the major splits there.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.500
Yeah.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.860
Here's a couple of other lieutenants.

17:24.860 --> 17:25.860
I was a third-patoon leader.

17:25.860 --> 17:30.980
The gentleman in the middle was second-patoon and the gentleman on the far left was first-patoon.

17:30.980 --> 17:33.980
In Cambodia both of them got shot.

17:33.980 --> 17:34.980
Both survived.

17:34.980 --> 17:38.340
The one in the middle came back for a second time.

17:38.340 --> 17:41.900
His injuries weren't so bad but then about a month or a half later, two months later

17:41.900 --> 17:44.420
he also got here the second time.

17:44.420 --> 17:48.860
I was the fortunate one who managed to always stay out of harm's way.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.100
And that's that Gorni Angel I said it was on my shoulder.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.340
I was in the same mix as they were.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.980
We went into Cambodia.

17:54.980 --> 17:58.220
There was three line buttoons officers.

17:58.220 --> 18:01.900
We had a forward observer and a commander and of those officers I was the only one who came

18:01.900 --> 18:02.900
back on skate.

18:02.900 --> 18:03.900
Okay.

18:03.900 --> 18:07.020
Let's move on to the next photograph.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.740
Another photograph of you.

18:08.740 --> 18:10.500
That is a rice paddy during the summertime.

18:10.500 --> 18:15.060
It's dried up so they don't have rice in there right now growing during the wet seasons

18:15.060 --> 18:16.060
months since.

18:16.060 --> 18:19.020
That would be filled with water probably up to your ankle.

18:19.020 --> 18:23.380
And typically even during wetter, dry time of season you never walk on the berms or the

18:23.380 --> 18:25.620
high ground you see in the background.

18:25.620 --> 18:28.580
That's where the NVA or VC would set their baby traps.

18:28.580 --> 18:31.460
We would walk through the water or through the flat part there.

18:31.460 --> 18:35.860
Now what we're doing here is that we're probably getting ready to go in after spending a week

18:35.860 --> 18:38.540
or two out, pulling ambushes.

18:38.540 --> 18:44.100
And we always like to make sure that we shoot through our old shells, our old weaponry,

18:44.100 --> 18:46.300
getting it clear, clean after weapons.

18:46.300 --> 18:51.260
You don't want to take back bullets that maybe got rusted or maybe got jammed or hit around

18:51.260 --> 18:53.540
while you're going through the jungle getting off helicopters.

18:53.540 --> 18:57.580
So we pretty much clean our weapons and then re-supply ourselves when we got back to the

18:57.580 --> 18:58.580
base camp.

18:58.580 --> 19:01.420
Now naturally we would use all our ammunition at this point because you never know when

19:01.420 --> 19:05.060
you're way back to your base camp you might get shot down.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.580
Before we would shoot maybe half our load here to clear our weapon.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.580
Plus we'd cross-train.

19:08.580 --> 19:11.580
I would be shooting the M79 and getting used to it.

19:11.580 --> 19:15.220
Nothing I would be moving from his rifle over to the machine gun.

19:15.220 --> 19:18.860
So we cross-train so that if one person went down somebody else could also use that weapon.

19:18.860 --> 19:21.340
Okay, let's move on to the next one.

19:21.340 --> 19:25.540
Now this was actually back in the States during training in Colorado, right?

19:25.540 --> 19:26.820
I just thought it was a great picture.

19:26.820 --> 19:30.940
Well it is and you can tell that was not Vietnam because look at the starts uniform.

19:30.940 --> 19:34.300
You would not be wearing that over in the jungles of Vietnam.

19:34.300 --> 19:38.860
When I came out after two years of the Army I went into the reserves and I didn't have

19:38.860 --> 19:43.940
to go active reserve because I had spent time Vietnam so I was under the title of inactive

19:43.940 --> 19:44.940
reserves.

19:44.940 --> 19:50.140
Which meant that if I was needed at some summer camp for two weeks I could be called up.

19:50.140 --> 19:53.780
Well this was a mech unit that came in out of Nebraska who did their train over Fort

19:53.780 --> 19:55.300
Carson in Colorado.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.380
So they called me up to come in.

19:56.380 --> 20:00.460
They were short a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

20:00.460 --> 20:02.580
me go up there and spend two weeks.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.140
And so I was working with mech unit.

20:04.140 --> 20:05.300
That's an honor personal carrier.

20:05.300 --> 20:06.300
Right.

20:06.300 --> 20:09.420
And what you do, it's a little bit different than doing infantry.

20:09.420 --> 20:13.100
In infantry you're going to be very close together when you're moving through jungles.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.820
You space a little bit more when you open area.

20:14.820 --> 20:19.700
When you're working with mech and eyes units you're looking more to conventional warfare.

20:19.700 --> 20:20.700
Right.

20:20.700 --> 20:24.860
Something you expect to do if you were Germany fighting in that train at the post of Vietnam.

20:24.860 --> 20:25.860
Okay.

20:25.860 --> 20:26.860
Let's move on to the next one.

20:26.860 --> 20:30.460
The next one was actually taken from a book that you supplied the picture.

20:30.460 --> 20:33.340
I'm going to let you talk about the book real quick because we're running short on time.

20:33.340 --> 20:37.340
But this is a book written by a current professor at Blaine College about Cambodia.

20:37.340 --> 20:38.940
Talk, and that is you on the right.

20:38.940 --> 20:39.940
Talk about that.

20:39.940 --> 20:40.940
That's correct.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.500
About five, six, seven years ago I was reading one of the, the, the local paper here and

20:44.500 --> 20:49.620
there was someone inquiring if you were an officer or an enlisted man that had fallen

20:49.620 --> 20:50.620
Cambodia to 1970.

20:50.620 --> 20:52.580
Please get in touch with this person.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.900
So I thought about it for a couple of days and gave him a call.

20:55.300 --> 21:00.740
And as a lady who actually grew up in Cambodia, her dad had been secretary of their state or

21:00.740 --> 21:02.460
secretary of defense.

21:02.460 --> 21:07.900
And she grew up in time frame of the Kilmer Rouge who took over Cambodia in the 1970s to

21:07.900 --> 21:10.460
1975, the Killing Fields time.

21:10.460 --> 21:15.060
And she wanted to find out some information about the military, American military activities

21:15.060 --> 21:16.860
in Cambodia.

21:16.860 --> 21:21.240
And I was able to provide her some information of which when the book was written she did

21:22.240 --> 21:25.200
mention my name once or twice which I felt very gratified for.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.200
But she was a great lady.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.800
She spent five, six years writing this book.

21:27.800 --> 21:28.800
It's now published.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.360
They can be booked up and picked up in a lot of the local bookstore.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.680
This is where we're coming down from.

21:32.680 --> 21:36.400
Contain head down towards the Cambodian border.

21:36.400 --> 21:41.000
We spent one or two days pulling security for transportation trucks along this route.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.400
And then we went into Cambodia itself to fight.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.400
Okay.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.640
Let's move on to, I believe our last picture.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.120
And there's your dad and there you are sitting next to him.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.600
And this was a time that he was honored in Louisiana, right?

21:51.600 --> 21:52.600
Talk about this.

21:52.600 --> 21:59.600
Well, back in the 1960s during the Cuban crisis my dad, the 49th armory was called up.

21:59.600 --> 22:02.720
Headquartered out of temple, he was a battalion commander.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.360
And they were sent down to Fort Poc, Louisiana.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.600
And all the armory units of the 49th were called down there.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.760
He spent a full year down there.

22:09.760 --> 22:14.400
And so this was probably about six, seven, eight years ago.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.400
They were going on our plaque to the 49th.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.880
And he was requested to come down there.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.640
And he was, so the honoree.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.960
And it gave me an opportunity to spend time with my dad here, more of the war stories that

22:24.960 --> 22:26.320
I heard as a kid.

22:26.320 --> 22:30.760
And as you get older and you've experienced that war situation, you've been there, you

22:30.760 --> 22:34.280
can ask questions a little bit differently than if you've never seen combat.

22:34.280 --> 22:39.520
So I was able now to go in there and find out specifically what did it feel like?

22:39.520 --> 22:42.760
You know, a lot of generic terms you ask, you know, what was it like in a war?

22:42.960 --> 22:44.920
And a person will give you a generic answer.

22:44.920 --> 22:49.800
But if you ask a specific question, like when that's shrapnel buzzes by your head,

22:49.800 --> 22:53.000
or you take casualty in your hand, it's holding down a wound until the men

22:53.000 --> 22:55.600
get there, what went through your head?

22:55.600 --> 23:00.400
I was now able to discuss that with him in a sort of a soldier to soldier way.

23:00.400 --> 23:06.600
Joe, you were awarded the bronze star medal on two occasions for your action on two consecutive days.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.080
May 8th and 9th, 1970.

23:09.080 --> 23:11.200
Talking about what happened those two days.

23:11.280 --> 23:19.280
We went into Cambodia and up until then, most of our combat was small unit back in Vietnam.

23:19.280 --> 23:23.280
The kind of Cambodia was a larger unit's fight in each other.

23:23.280 --> 23:26.280
And we had landed our helicopters.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.440
I was in my opportunity with the first two to go in.

23:28.440 --> 23:32.520
And as soon as we hit the ground helicopters left, we were hit from the woodline by the NBA.

23:32.520 --> 23:35.120
They were detection of cash that was very important to them.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.880
We had to fight our way into the jungles for next two or three days.

23:37.880 --> 23:43.120
We unsuccessfully kept trying to take that cash and that particular bunker complex, which

23:43.120 --> 23:44.800
we finally did take.

23:44.800 --> 23:49.160
During that time frame, I spent a lot of time in the front giving directions, pulling

23:49.160 --> 23:54.160
wounded men back, and the Army thought that maybe I deserved a bronze star for that.

23:54.160 --> 23:57.320
I'm sure there was a lot of soldiers that did a lot more than I did that deserved a bronze

23:57.320 --> 24:00.560
star didn't get it, but somehow I got nominated for it.

24:00.560 --> 24:06.200
On the next day or two later, we were bibwacked along one of the rivers there in Cambodia,

24:06.200 --> 24:08.440
and we were hit, ready to do another mission.

24:08.440 --> 24:12.240
And the Navy came down one of the rivers there, spotted us.

24:12.240 --> 24:15.480
And they had been in the ambush several times the previous day, and they were a little bit

24:15.480 --> 24:16.480
on the touchy side.

24:16.480 --> 24:20.400
And apparently our hire command did not warn them that we were there.

24:20.400 --> 24:25.080
So they immediately opened fire with us with quad 50s, and they had an automatic 79 grenade

24:25.080 --> 24:28.360
launcher, and we started taking severe casualties.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.840
And someone had to get communication with them.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.000
We did not have their radio frequency.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.160
So someone had to get up and actually motioned them.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.640
We were Americans.

24:35.640 --> 24:39.200
And I guess I drew the black vein because I ended up being the one that did it.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.160
And apparently again, somebody thought I deserved something for that.

24:42.160 --> 24:48.480
Again, medals should have been more just than deserved elsewhere, I'm sure.

24:48.480 --> 24:52.240
We need to move along, but with about a month left in your service, you were sent to the

24:52.240 --> 24:56.720
first cavalry, but then eventually sent back to the 25th.

24:56.720 --> 25:00.600
And talk about the message that you got that the chief of staff wanted to see you and

25:00.600 --> 25:02.080
what he had to say to you.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.480
So the 25th empty vision received orders.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.640
They were going to return home.

25:06.640 --> 25:10.120
And Bobby, October, November of 1970.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.520
Because I still had a little over a month left in country.

25:12.520 --> 25:15.280
I was not able to ship home with a lot of the troops.

25:15.280 --> 25:18.520
I was sent to the first cab, figuring I still had a month and a half left, and I could

25:18.520 --> 25:19.920
be of service to them.

25:19.920 --> 25:23.760
Went to their one week school, and they realized, hey, you're a little still too sharp.

25:23.760 --> 25:25.240
You won't benefit us.

25:25.240 --> 25:28.160
And by that time I got orders to return back to the 25th infantry.

25:28.160 --> 25:31.320
Well, as soon as I hit the ground, there was a gentleman standing there, a lieutenant

25:31.320 --> 25:34.640
said that the chief of staff, full colonel, wanted to visit with me.

25:34.640 --> 25:38.840
So I entered his office, and normally a lieutenant does not want to face the chief of staff.

25:38.840 --> 25:40.920
There's something very, very wrong.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.840
This case he had my file in front of him.

25:42.840 --> 25:46.240
He indicated, well, you went to Ranger School, you went to Airborne, received a few

25:46.240 --> 25:47.240
metal.

25:47.240 --> 25:48.240
He said, you're exactly the person I'm looking for.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.280
I said, oh no, not one of these deep, short, black missions are going to send me on.

25:52.280 --> 25:56.120
And it ended up being that he needed someone to take that at the infancy, the vision colors

25:56.120 --> 25:59.240
of the 25th infantry back to Scofield Barracks in Hawaii.

25:59.240 --> 26:03.080
And they felt like that I was the white person to do that.

26:03.080 --> 26:08.600
And it was quite an honor for me to receive the orders to do this.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.840
I trained with about 30 other gentlemen.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.400
We brought all the regimental colors in.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.360
Several of these troops had been middle-owner winners.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.960
So I've got to hear their stories.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.120
They were quite the heroes.

26:21.120 --> 26:26.520
And then in the middle of December we flew into Scofield Barracks in Hawaii, met by a

26:26.520 --> 26:27.520
man.

26:27.520 --> 26:31.520
Then next couple days the colors were transferred back to the 25th there in a way.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.520
I know that was quite an honor for you.

26:33.520 --> 26:36.600
And it's something that probably, of all your memories of your Vietnam experience, it

26:36.600 --> 26:41.360
was that at the end bringing back the colors that is maybe the most meaningful to you.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.360
It is one that I'll always remember.

26:43.360 --> 26:48.720
And I just, that a lot of the soldiers that went to Vietnam did not have the great fortune

26:48.720 --> 26:51.200
I had of returning back to the United States.

26:51.200 --> 26:55.320
Most of the soldiers came back home and most of them were not met at the airports.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.760
There were no bands or anybody who would congratulate them.

26:57.760 --> 27:01.040
And yet here I was coming back with a band waiting for me.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.040
Congratulations.

27:02.040 --> 27:08.880
And so that maybe feels extremely well thought of like I, you know, my time and service

27:08.880 --> 27:09.880
was appreciated.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.360
Joe Brewster, thank you very much for your service.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.360
Thank you for being here.

27:12.360 --> 27:13.360
I appreciate it.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.760
Growing up in Temple Joe Brewster was sure of two things.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.440
He would be an A&M cadet and he would be a soldier.

27:18.440 --> 27:20.720
He served both roles with distinction.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.880
And that's definitely a family trait.

27:22.880 --> 27:26.560
We thank Joe Brewster and all veterans for their service and we thank our underwriter

27:26.560 --> 27:28.080
First National Bank.

27:28.080 --> 27:32.480
For more stories of veterans, be sure to read Brass' Valley Heroes every Sunday in the

27:32.480 --> 27:33.480
Eagle.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.360
For Lieutenant Joe Brewster, I'm Tom Turboville.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.960
We'll see you next time on Veterans of the Valley.
