00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hitting the shuttle Columbia seconds after liftoff. As you watch it over and over you see it's clearer.

00:07.000 --> 00:17.000
More detailed, more alarming than anything you've seen before. NASA couldn't believe simple phone could destroy an 89 ton spacecraft.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
NASA was wrong.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
You see to hit, you say, ow, that hurt. Doesn't that set off alarm bells?

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
It should have. We literally have dozens and dozens of pieces of evidence all pointing in the same direction.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Just today, new evidence about what caused the shuttle Columbia to break apart.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
We have found the smoking gun.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
I kept insisting we can't rule out a flight safety issue. In other words, we got the shuttle back before we've phoned damage.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
So let's hope we can do it again.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
It wasn't a hope. Hope was not a management method I'm familiar with at all.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
It's really getting really pretty out there.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
It's lost four separate temperature casters on the left side of the VF hole.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Look at the chunks coming off of it.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Something has gone terribly wrong here.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Like you say, block the doors.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
It's one of those moments in your life where you say, I can't believe this is happening.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
She goes, mom, is daddy okay? I said, sweetie, I don't think he has.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
Looks like NASA has lost all seven astronauts.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
This is all that is left of the space shuttle Columbia. Nearly 84,000 pieces of charred debris

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
are raved throughout a massive hangar at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Over the next hour, you're going to hear the first hand minute by minute accounts of Columbia's last voyage

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
from the people who lived it and the people who investigated it.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Good evening. I'm Charles Gibson.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
You have read the headlines and you saw the breakup.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
But tonight for the first time, you will hear the inside story of Columbia's final mission.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
We'll be back in 60 seconds.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
There's flowers, music, photographer.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Everyone's going to see our smiles.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Before they're wedding, a hundred couples use new coldgate simply white night.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Once a night, it absorbs fast.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I just close my mouth and went to bed.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Fourteen days and they're whiter.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
It's that easy.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
New coldgate simply white night. Guaranteed.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
Want to see fewer wrinkles but not ready for chemical meals or injections?

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
New Georgina Healthy Skin Anti-Rinkle Cream has retinal, essential for skin cell regeneration.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
It's dermatologist proven to visibly reduce lines and wrinkles.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Would you use it?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I would.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
New Georgina Healthy Skin Anti-Rinkle Cream.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Columbia, final mission returns.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Once again, Charles Gibson.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
This really is the nerve center of NASA.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Mission control at the Johnson Space Center.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
In Houston.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
On the morning of February 1st, there were 20 engineers and flight directors in this room,

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
each of them monitoring thousands of bits of data coming back from the space shuttle Columbia.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
After 16 days in space, the seven astronauts on the shuttle were just 32 minutes from touchdown.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
February 1st, last night.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
The first time we had a flight in the United States was a little bit of a big deal.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
The ship was just in the past.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
February 1st, 2003.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Landing day, 8.44 a.m.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
Traveling at 17,000 miles an hour, Columbia begins its fiery descent through the Earth's atmosphere.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
It's really neat to set bright orange yoke.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Out over the nose all around the oven.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Outside, the environment is unforgiving.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
The temperature, 3000 degrees, super hot gases flicker like lightning.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
Yeah, you definitely going to be outside now.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Maxion, GNC, you ready?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Right back, we're ready.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Gencies go.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Mission control has run through its checklist with Columbia Pilot Willie McCool.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And we're ready, Willie. No doubt this.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Copy that, I'll be there.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Flight director, Leroy Kane, is in charge.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
When we came in that morning and began to get ready for our de-orbit preparation and entry activities.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
It was right down the middle, normal.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Just under 30 minutes to touch down for Columbia now.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
At Kennedy Space Center in Florida, family and onlookers gather near the runway.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
John Clark, astronaut Laurel Clark's husband, is waiting with their eight-year-old son, Ian.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
The kids are all out in the grass.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
We're all running around and playing and having a blast.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
Columbia's altitude now 54 miles, as it continues to descend into the atmosphere.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
8.48 am.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Mechanical Systems Officer Jeff Kling is monitoring Columbia's descent.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Shuttle was very ready, systems wise to come in that the weather was perfect.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
It was going to be an absolutely perfect entry.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
At 8.54 am, Kling is the first to notice a problem and notifies Kane.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
At 5.00 am, I'm just lost four separate temperature transducers on the left side of the vehicle.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Four high return temps.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Okay, is there anything common to them?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
DSC or MDM or anything?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
No commonality.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
No commonality.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
At about that time in Nevada, an amateur astronomer is filming the shuttle's reentry.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Here we come approaching Venus.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Whoa, holy crap, that was weird.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
It's going really fast.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
Just two minutes later, the shuttle is traveling over Arizona.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Another home video.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Look at the chunks coming off of it.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
What the heck is that?

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
Small pieces of the shuttle are breaking off, but incredibly no one.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Neither mission control nor the crew is aware of it.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
CNC flight.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
By CNC.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Everything went good to you.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Control and rate and everything is nominal, right?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
So far fly, we have good trims.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I don't see anything out of the ordinary.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Okay.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Then I lose some more sensors in the left wheel well.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
The tires feel a little bit pressure on left outboard and left inboard both tires.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
I felt that icy water in my veins.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
Structural engineer Rodney Rocha is monitoring data in a back room with other engineers.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
It went off in my head.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
It's happening.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
We're having a wing burn through.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
We're having something terrible is happening in the wheel well.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
8.59 a.m.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Mission control radios, Commander Rick Husband.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
And Columbia Houston, we see your tire pressure messages and we did not copy your last.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
The transmission suddenly falls off.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
It's cut off right in the middle, just like that.

07:08.000 --> 07:16.000
That got my attention because that is way out of the range of anything we ever had.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
And flighty come.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Be calm.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
I'll get four temperature sensors on the bottom line data that are off scale low.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
The environmental officer says now she has lost some temperatures on the left side of the vehicle.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
The data that I look at is no longer there.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
A completely different system that they look at is no longer there.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
A cascading event has happened on the left side of the vehicle and we're no longer communicating with it.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
We're out of control in mission control.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Columbia Houston, Com Check.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Columbia Houston, UHF Com Check.

07:59.000 --> 08:08.000
The second's become very long as I'm watching the clock.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
It drags on.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Final one, you expecting tracking?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
One minute ago flight.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
We should have had air-to-ground communications and tracking and things.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
When we didn't have that, that's when the butterflies started to appear, that sinking feeling and the pittier stomach.

08:31.000 --> 08:40.000
Bill Reedy, a former astronaut and now a top NASA administrator, is waiting near the runway with his boss, NASA Chief Sean O'Keefe.

08:40.000 --> 08:48.000
A look of absolute deep, deep concern on Bill Reedy's face told me everything before he said a word.

08:48.000 --> 08:57.000
At Mission Control, Phil Engelof, a mission operations official, gets a call from a colleague who had just seen the shuttle breaking up over Texas.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Engelof shares the news with Kane.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
The pilot is on the way to the airport.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
GC flight.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
GC flight.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Flight GC.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Block the doors.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Copy.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
No data, no phone calls, no transmissions anywhere, into or out.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
FCOH's contingency plan procedure.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
FCOH's checklist.

09:27.000 --> 09:41.000
It's one of those moments in your life where you say, I can't believe this is happening, but I realized that it really was happening, and that I still had a responsibility to lead the team through it.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Astronaut Rick Husband's wife Evelyn is waiting for him to land.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
We watched the clock go to zero, and then it starts counting up again.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
And you just, I don't know how to explain it, but you just have that sick, sick feeling.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
Apparently it just appears that something happened with the orbiter.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
I heard someone say we need to get the families back to crew quarters.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Laura grabs one of them, she goes, mom, is daddy okay?

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
I said sweetie, I don't think he is, but I don't know anything.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
NASA says they have lost communication.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
The head of flight crew comes in and he goes, we lost contact with the vehicle.

10:19.000 --> 10:28.000
At the altitude that this happened, it's highly likely this is not survivable, but we don't have confirmation.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
But I don't want to give you false hope.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
There was a massive amount of crying and kids were screaming, it was horrible sounds.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Horrible.

10:36.000 --> 10:44.000
Flight controllers here in Mission Control are securing all their information, notes and data, gathered from the spacecraft.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
RCC, the rescue coordination center is mobilizing to that area, got me.

10:51.000 --> 11:04.000
The thought went through my mind at a time that if somehow the crew module stayed intact long enough, and low enough, it's low enough that maybe some of the crew members could have got out.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
Kane's tear says it all, there would be no miracles.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
At 9.29am, NASA declares an emergency.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
Video of the shuttle break up taken by a local TV station is broadcast nationally.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
The very nature of what we do is we're there to help.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
And there are literally hundreds and thousands of circumstances where we can help.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
This was a day where I just felt very helpless.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
Up next, for the first time, the engineer who tried to sound the alarm.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
It appeared to me that we were hamstrung.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
It just looked like we were hung out to drive.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
Columbia, final mission, will return in a moment.

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
We're here to learn how to trust our wireless phones, which is hard because we've all been hurt before.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Johnny, we're accepting that our phones are unreliable.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
That some features work here and not over there.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Try hugging the phone, not choking it.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
Sprints is different. All your services work the same wherever you go.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
On the most complete, all digital wireless network in the nation.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
Like voicemail and email, even clear calls, I think we just made a breakthrough.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
I'll see us from Sprint. Try the nation's most complete wireless network.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
Now that's twisted. Like a bone refreshing jumble of fruit flavors in tropicala twister.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
In totally jamming combos like watermelon strawberry swirl, twist things up.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Thank you, Parker.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Hello? Be right over.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
The 2003 Toyota Corolla. Take the fun as far as you want to.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Took you long enough?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
What's up? We need more chips now.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I'll go.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Introducing Red Lobsters World of Crab.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
Sweet snow crab lakes prepared with a variety of delicious new recipes from around the world.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
So how do you like your crab lakes?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
We've got some of the cake on here.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
It could really have an effect on you.

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
So come in today and try our new roasted cajun classic New England style or Asian garlic.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
And share your love of crab legs now at Red Lobster.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Show it to her!

14:03.000 --> 14:11.000
No fruits, no flowers, no colors, no scales.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Just pure moisture for healthier skin.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
That's the magic of lubricant developed by dermatologist.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
Lubriderms pure, uncomplicated formula gives you just the necessary ingredients you need.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
And nothing you don't.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
To keep dry skin at a distance every day.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Later, Gator.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Lubriderm.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
A pure approach to healthier skin.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
What do I want in the blade plug in?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Well, it'd be fresh.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
What about a night fright?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
A bright one.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
That goes off when you don't need it.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
And doesn't block my outlets.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Nobody else can say that.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Glaed plug ins extra outlet night light.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
The only one that freshens brightens and doesn't block your outlets.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Plugin' in, plugin' in.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Now that's a bright idea.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Plugin' to extra outlet night light.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
SC Johnson Family Company.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Hi. Hi.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Morgge application.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Me too.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Bye.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Bye.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
The Morgge application lists 80% less paperwork.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
From Bank of America, higher standards.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Thursday, it's J-Lo.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Just days before her hot new movie,

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
co-starring her leading man band Opens, plug.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
It's Lisa Marie Presley.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
Thursday, it's Diane Sawyer with two supercharged divas.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
It's too hot to miss.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
It's prime time.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
This cop's worst nightmare isn't the criminals.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
It's having this rookie for a partner.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Do you pray?

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Sometimes Christmas, you know, from a somewhere special.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Together, they're fighting crime.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
When they're not fighting each other.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Do you have a piece of the liver to the car?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
I'm hungry, sir.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Get out of here.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
Tenning, a new trauma Sundays this fall on ABC.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Soon after the launch of Columbia,

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
NASA knew that a significant piece of foam had hit the shuttle.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
But they didn't know it would lead to this.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
An analysis during the mission concluded that there was no significant risk to the shuttle.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Some engineers, however, were worried,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
one even begged for more information.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
The astronauts on Columbia, meanwhile,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
knew little of the problem.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
We go back to the time before launch,

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
when everything seemed so perfect.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Here you can actually see Columbia on the side of the...

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
At Kennedy Space Center, Dr. Laurel Clark,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
one of the astronauts makes this home video

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
for her eight-year-old son, Ian,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
showing off the rocket that will lift her into space.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
I can't wear a love-dew piece to it.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
It won't be that long.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
Two days later, January 16, 2003,

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
the astronauts take their last steps on Earth.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I mean, you watched the launch,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
and you just really pray that everything goes well.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
When Rick flew the first time in space,

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
I think I was much more aware of the risk.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
We have a go for me and I should start.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Three, two, one.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
We have booster ignition and lift-off

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
and space shuttle coming over that multitude of measurements.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
Probably 80% of the concern is the first two minutes.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
After that, my fears went away.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
I probably let my guard down sooner than I should have.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
Columbia now rolling on to the proper asthma for a 39-year-old.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
All eyes follow the shuttle as it streaks toward the heavens.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Columbia, you sent your go at the throttle up.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
We're going to go at the throttle up.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
Everything looking good on board, Columbia.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
It seems like the perfect lift-off.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
No one realizes that Columbia and its crew

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
may have just suffered a fatal blow.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Eight and a half minutes later,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
as the shuttle glides into its orbit,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
the crew has no way of knowing that 16 days from now,

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
there will be no way home.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Day two, January 17th,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Mission Control wakes up the crew with a song.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Congratulations on your first wake up in space.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Hey, good morning.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
The astronauts are starting more than 140 science experiments.

18:50.000 --> 18:57.000
On the ground, analysts begin a routine review of the launch films.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
But at 81.7 seconds into the flight,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
they are stunned at what they see.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
A large chunk of insulation, foam,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
breaks off the external fuel tank

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
and slams into Columbia,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
exploding into a shower of particles.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Word spreads quickly.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
NASA engineer Rodney Rocha gets a call from a colleague.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
She tells me, Rodney, do you know that something hit the wing on asset?

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
And I must have gasped audibly

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
because she told me I did later.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
That night Rocha sees the video for the first time.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
He has seen foam hits before,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
but this one is much bigger.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
He plays the video over and over.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
It looked like it was potentially serious.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
So I was very anxious to know more.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
NASA assembles a team of dozens of engineers,

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
including Rocha, to assess the damage.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
It's estimated that the foam piece weighs about two pounds

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
and is traveling at over 500 miles an hour.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
But the video is grainy.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
The impact hard to see.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Basic information is unavailable.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
The team of experts

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
kept reiterating or emphasizing

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
that we needed a better image.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Day six, Rocha sends an urgent email

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
to engineering managers and behalf of the team.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Can NASA get better pictures of the shuttle

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
using ground-based telescopes or spy satellites?

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
The email is blunt.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
Can we petition big for outside agency assistance?

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
And I deliberately boldface that statement

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
because I want it to be an attention-gitter.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
It were really serious here.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
We really, really need this.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Rocha never gets an answer.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
The next day he learns that shuttle managers

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
have no intention of asking the military

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
to take photos of Columbia in orbit.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I was flabbergasted.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I was stunned.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
What could this mean?

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Why? It doesn't say why.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
It seems to imply we already know an answer.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
We already have it figured out.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
We already know what we're going to do.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
You're just kind of a sideline show.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
As it turns out, the engineering team's request

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
for photos from the military isn't turned down.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
It's never passed on to the shuttle managers

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
who might act on it.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
NASA says pictures are requested only in emergencies.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
We didn't think it was an emergency.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Without a photo, it appeared to me

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
that we were hamstrung.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
It just looked like we were hung out to drive.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Word of the decision sparks new emails

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
from worried engineers.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Veteran landing gear expert Carlisle Campbell writes,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
quote, there is lots of speculation.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
Could we get a burn through into the wheel well upon entry?

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
There was always that lingering concern.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
Is everything going to be okay?

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
There's a rain Houston, what a wonderful thought.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
They ate, onboard the Columbia,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
the crew wakes up to Akuna Matata,

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
a song about no worries.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
And it's really good day to wake up today

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
and nothing to worry about.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
A lot of work to do.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
The astronauts are relaxed, even playful.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
They have no idea about the foam hit on liftoff.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
But here comes that day's round after two.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
As you know, he used to be in the circus.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
So he's very, very happy.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
On the ground, engineers led by Boeing,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
a major NASA contractor,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
are completing a foam damage analysis

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
to be distributed that day.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Steve Oswald is a senior vice president at Boeing.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
The conclusion that we came up with

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
was that the damage expected damage

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
from that foam strike was not going to be a safety flight issue,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
but may cause some damage to the orbiter

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
that would have to be fixed before the next flight.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
But is the report reliable?

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
There are disturbing questions.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
The analysis focused on potential damage to the tiles

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
on the underside of the shuttle's wing,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
not the wing's leading edge.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
It would be a critical mistake.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
And there's another problem.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
The size of the foam piece that hit the shuttle

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
is estimated to be far larger than anything ever tested,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
600 times larger.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Brian O'Connor is NASA's highest ranking safety official

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
and a former astronaut.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
The report says a flight condition is significantly

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
outside of test database.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Which means we don't have any test,

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
which would really show us what kind of an effect

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
this big of foam hit would have.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
That's right.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
So, is it fair to have reached the conclusion then

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
that there was no safety of flight issue?

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
Uh, and I'm going to say in retrospect, probably not.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
Late in day eight, for the first time,

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
astronauts learn of the foam hit.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
They are sent this grainy video

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
and an email that dismisses the foam hit as, quote,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
not even worth mentioning.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
There is absolutely no concern.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
On day nine, Rocha attends a critical meeting

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
where the damage assessment is summarized for top shuttle managers.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
While the foam impact had been discussed previously

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
at this meeting, there's no debate, no probing questions.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
ABC News has obtained a transcript of a discussion

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
of the foam hit at the meeting.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Chairwoman Linda Ham says, quote,

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
no safety of flight and no issue for this mission,

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
nothing that we are going to do different.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
And I remember a pause and her looking around the room.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
Like, it's okay to say something now, but no one did.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
I just couldn't do it.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
I was too low down here in the organization

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
and she's way up here.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
You are duty bound as a member of this team

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
to voice your concerns in particular

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
as they relate to safety of flight.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Columbia's flight director, Leroy Kane, says there's no excuse

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
for not speaking up.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
If you're really worried about it,

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
you stand up in that meeting and you holler to your herd.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
Yeah, and quite frankly, you wouldn't have to holler.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
You stand up and you say, here's my concern.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Here's why it's my concern and I'm not comfortable.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
But Rocha says he couldn't challenge the report.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
He had no data, no pictures, nothing to substantiate his concerns.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
So on day 11, he even reluctantly agrees

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
there is no safety of flight issue.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
It does look like a contradiction.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I was struggling to be okay with it.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
Because I really did believe the team did a competent job.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
The best they could do.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
But subconsciously or nagging at me underneath all of that

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
was we might be wrong.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
But the decision had been made.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
The photo request killed.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
The analysis, wrong as it was, accepted.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
You put it behind you and you move on to the next thing.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Because there always is the next thing.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
And I believe in this case, in the end,

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
I fully believe that every single person in the organization

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
was in agreement that we did not have a safety of flight issue.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
On their next to last day in space,

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
the crew wakes up to John Lennon's imagine.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
Earlier in their final press conference,

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
Commander Rick Husband had praised the entire NASA team.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
The bigger team who makes this entire mission possible

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
is the team on the ground.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
The pilot's first astronaut Ilan Ramon made a wish for peace

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
as the shuttle passed over his troubled part of the world.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
I wish we will have a peaceful and

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
for living very soon.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
Payload specialist Mike Anderson said he hopes their experiments

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
will make a difference.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
The scientists are spectacular and we just can't wait to bring it

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
all home so the scientists can really take it close to what we've done.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
In the final family teleconference,

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
Laurel Clark promised her son she'd be home soon.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
I love you both.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Give each other hugs so I can keep on with your patience.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
It was the last time Ilan would ever see his mother alive.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Bye!

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Thanks, Bob.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Thanks to you.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
Coming up, inside the investigation into what went wrong

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
in a daring rescue plan, could the astronauts have been saved?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
You try a rescue.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
You must.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Columbia, final mission.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
We'll be back after this.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
From city to city, state to state and coast to coast,

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
Verizon Wireless is helping to bring families closer together

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
with unlimited night and weekend minutes.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
It's all part of the America's Choice National Family Share Plan,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
giving your family unlimited night and weekend minutes

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
to share on up to four separate lines so they can say,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
whatever, whenever, wherever.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
And now, safe big on Select LG phones.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Verizon Wireless, we never stop working for you.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
Come rain or shine. Can you hear me now?

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Good.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Have you been quilting long, Wanda?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
No, this is just a part-time gig for me, kid.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I don't even like quilting.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
How can you say that?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
We specially craft every sheet of quilting northern

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
with two quilted pies of softness, strength, and absorbency.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
To leave you feeling clean.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Kids.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Oh, loose.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
What?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
You girls need to get a life life.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Goodness, what a nightmare.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Quilted Northern.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
It's all in the quilting.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Bring the view to your hometown.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Visit quilted northern.com to learn how.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Great, great, great.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Okay, got the order.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
You want something made?

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
I'm going to go with K.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
My wonder of deficit.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Hey, you're welcome.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Don't these look yummy?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
I made them myself.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
You just have to try one.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
It'll give you hard burns so bad.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
It'll melt the buttons right off your shirt.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
It's different for people with acid reflux disease.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
And all that acid reflux may have puckered the lining of your esophagus.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
You should ask your doctor about the purple pill called nexium.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
And these?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
These are sure to send you home early.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
For many people, with one prescription nexium daily,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
hard burn goes away and stays away.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
And could keep you up all night?

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
And nexium relief goes deeper to heal erosions in the esophagus

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
acid reflux can cause.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
So you don't just feel better.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
You are better.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Other serious stomach conditions may still exist.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Doctor to your doctor.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Nexium has a low occurrence of side effects,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
including headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
Don't let acid reflux spoil the party.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Doop!

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Relief?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Healing?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Nexium.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
As the heat rises in the city, so does the crime.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Gone!

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
There's only one way to cool it down.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Police!

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Police!

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
NYB Nebulu ABC Tuesday 109 Central.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
Friday, finally, Angelina Tollie talks about her strange marriage.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Do you talk to Belbron?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
And all the strange rumors.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Do you consider yourself bisexual?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Friday, its Angelina's wild life.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
You're going to get me to cry.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I will not let you cry.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
On 2020.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
If your loved one was aboard a space shuttle

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
and mission control knew there was no way home,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
would you want them to know?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Would you want to know?

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
We'll ask three NASA legends and the astronauts' families.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
Columbia, final mission continues after this from our ABC stations.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I'm Carly Gugino and I'm playing Karen Sisko.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
Karen Sisko is a formidable opponent.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
She will take you down.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
She's a US marshal.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Sexy and tough.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
She can hold her own with any guy.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
She's an incredibly competent woman.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
And inside, she's a really tough little girl.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
She wants to have a life.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
Always hoping that the person who comes around the corner

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
is going to be Mr. Wright.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
But they're usually Mr. Rome.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
From executive producer Danny DeVita, Karen Sisko follows the bachelor.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
ABC Wednesdays this fall.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.860
The

32:21.860 --> 32:24.000
World's End

32:24.000 --> 32:25.860
The

32:25.860 --> 32:29.000
World's End

32:29.000 --> 32:31.860
The

32:31.860 --> 32:32.000
World's End

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
We need your team to check out something that came in hot this morning.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
They have many enemies.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Somebody else got through.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
They have only one mission.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
They know the drill.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Get the information and you get back here.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
To keep us safe.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
ABC presents a powerful new trauma.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Like somebody wanting to blow up school.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Either tariffs sent by tariffs.

32:50.000 --> 32:58.000
We're running out of time.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
You are at a time.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
Red Matrix Thursdays this fall on ABC.

33:02.000 --> 33:09.000
And now from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Charles Gibson.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
This is the kind of foam we're talking about.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
And it's hard to believe that a piece of this stuff weighing about two pounds, 20 inches long

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
could actually cause the breakup of an 89 tons spacecraft.

33:21.000 --> 33:26.000
But after months of analysis, investigators believe that's exactly what happened.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
The foam would have hit the leading edge of the shuttle's left wing in about this area.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
And it's this reconstructed wing with actual pieces of the shuttle suspended behind plastic

33:35.000 --> 33:41.000
that led investigators to their theory of what happened to Columbia in its final moments.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
As the shuttle approached the California coast at more than 23 times,

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
the speed of sound, its reentry was normal until 8.52 a.m.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000
Superheated gas or plasma entered the breach in the shuttle's left wing.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
The wing began to melt from the inside out.

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
The crew had no idea that small pieces of debris were falling away from the shuttle.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
Over a four minute period, more than 160 measurements failed.

34:08.000 --> 34:14.000
As the plasma burned through, the left wing and wheel well, like a runaway fire hose.

34:14.000 --> 34:19.000
The miracle may have been that Columbia kept flying normally for so long.

34:19.000 --> 34:26.000
But by 9 a.m., America's longest flying shuttle was disintegrating over Texas.

34:28.000 --> 34:42.000
The men and women of the Columbia had journeyed more than six million miles.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
And were minutes away from arrival and reunion.

34:48.000 --> 34:58.000
Today we remember not only one moment of tragedy, but seven lives of great purpose and achievement.

34:59.000 --> 35:05.000
As the world grieved along with the astronauts' families, a blue ribbon board,

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
the top accident investigators in the country, assembled in Houston.

35:10.000 --> 35:17.000
Their first job to recover the evidence, in the end 84,000 pieces of twisted metal glass and plastic,

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
spread out over more than 250 miles.

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
Over 15,000 people joined the biggest ground search ever.

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
Each find was precious, an astronaut's helmet, a mission patch.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
And most crucial of all, the shuttle's intact flight data recorder.

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
That data recorder, plus forensic clues from the debris, pointed investigators for the first time.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
To the wing's leading edge, as the spot where the foam hit,

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
retired Admiral Harold Gamern heads up the investigative board.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
We literally have dozens and dozens of pieces of evidence all pointing in the same direction.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
And we have no evidence, which points in any other direction.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
So to us, that's pretty compelling.

36:05.000 --> 36:10.000
The board kept enhancing the video of the foam strike.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
The board kept enhancing the video of the foam strike.

36:14.000 --> 36:19.000
And with each clearer image, the hit looked more ominous.

36:19.000 --> 36:25.000
There's nothing terribly mysterious about the fact that a piece of foam, this big,

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
going 700 feet per second, can do a lot of damage to whatever it hits.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
Retired NASA engineer Robert Thompson is one of the space shuttle's original architects.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
That's equivalent of taking a 200 pound way to 100 feet in the air and dropping it on you.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
It hurts.

36:44.000 --> 36:51.000
But the case of the falling foam, no matter how convincing, was still circumstantial.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
So the board conducted a series of tests.

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
One is recently as today, firing foam pieces the same size that broke off Columbia's fuel tank

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
into the leading edge of ring panels from another shuttle.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
We have found the smoking gun.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
You know, it was a visceral reaction.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
You know, it was shortly followed by, oh my god.

37:18.000 --> 37:24.000
The test confirmed the foam struck with enough force to open a hole in the wing panel.

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
The panel made of a substance called reinforced carbon carbon or RCC.

37:30.000 --> 37:40.000
I think foam hitting the wing leading edge of the orbiter at 500 miles an hour is the direct cause.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
Investigators were stunned to learn that foam was breaking off the fuel tank and hitting the orbiter

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
on every single shuttle flight, every one.

37:50.000 --> 37:55.000
In fact, just three months before Columbia, there had been a close call.

37:56.000 --> 38:02.000
A large chunk of foam narrowly mistitting the shuttle Atlantis after breaking off the same exact part of the fuel tank.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
Bill Redi is the associate administrator at NASA.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
We had the engineers go off and do the analysis on that.

38:09.000 --> 38:16.000
They arrived at the conclusion that there was no way for foam to get from this area on the tank to this area and strike the orbiter.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
But that analysis turned out to be straight out wrong.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
It may turn out in the end that it was in error.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
Actually, NASA had been given repeated warnings.

38:26.000 --> 38:33.000
This internal NASA document written three years ago showing that foam was a high-risk safety concern.

38:33.000 --> 38:47.000
And this report commissioned by NASA in 1990 saying that the tiles and protective panels on the shuttle could fail because of hits from debris in particular pieces of insulation or foam from the external tank.

38:47.000 --> 38:55.000
They had become accustomed to foam coming off and hitting the thermal protection system.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
It had happened on every flight.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
This was not deemed to be abnormal and so therefore an acceptable risk.

39:02.000 --> 39:09.000
In other words, we got the shuttle back before with foam damage to the tiles or the leading edge.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
So let's hope we can do it again.

39:11.000 --> 39:19.000
And the scope of the damage that had been assessed was really quite insignificant in the judgment of the engineering and analysis team.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
Now, again, that may prove to be a judgment call we call into question here.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
But it wasn't a hope. Hope is not a management method I'm familiar with at all.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Okay?

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
The foam had been defined early on as not a threat to flight safety.

39:34.000 --> 39:40.000
And even though the amount of damage increased, they continued to define it that way.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
Diane Vaughn is a consultant to the investigative board.

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
She spent 10 years studying NASA's culture after the Challenger disaster.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
She says the same thing happened back then.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
Only instead of foam, it was O-rings.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
And once again with Columbia, a NASA didn't see the danger until it was too late.

39:58.000 --> 40:03.000
I don't believe it's this foam. It's got to be something else that we don't know about yet.

40:03.000 --> 40:09.000
Ron did more set at the time. We analyzed it and we understood it. We were comfortable with that.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
And comfortable is not really what you want to be.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
Comfortable is what they became with Challenger.

40:15.000 --> 40:21.000
But most disturbing of all was what the board concluded about NASA's overall safety organization.

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
That budget cuts and other factors had left it dangerously inadequate.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
You said they don't have people. They don't have money. They don't have engineering.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
They don't have expertise and they don't have analysis.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
That's correct. That's pretty damning.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
That's right.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
And you said when you really look at it closely, there's no there, there.

40:40.000 --> 40:45.000
On paper it looks great. And there is a name and a telephone number in the desk

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
to do everything that needs to be done in the safety organization.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
But they are very, very shallow.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
NASA says they have more than 1700 people devoted to safety.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
And that whenever they find a problem, they fix it.

41:01.000 --> 41:09.000
In my experience, having gotten to NASA after the Challenger and been in the first astronaut class selected,

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
I have never seen any evidence of complacency. Quite the opposite.

41:13.000 --> 41:20.000
But the investigative board will insist that NASA fundamentally reassess how safety concerns are communicated.

41:20.000 --> 41:27.000
There is no excuse investigators say for the engineers warnings to not have reached top shuttle managers.

41:27.000 --> 41:35.000
The professional system by which professional engineers express, express legitimate safety concerns

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
up the chain of command, that system broke.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
It wasn't just the foam debris hit.

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
If that's what it turns out to be, that took Columbia out of the sky.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
It was also a failure of the organizational system.

41:48.000 --> 41:54.000
It's a tragedy because people at NASA, like Rodney Rocha,

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
all of them are going to spend their lives.

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
What if I had done this? What if I had done this?

42:01.000 --> 42:07.000
Not seeing themselves as part of an organizational system that failed.

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
NASA says it will implement everything the board recommends and go further.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
Last week, Linda Hamm, who chaired that critical meeting where a decision was made

42:16.000 --> 42:21.000
that there was no safety of flight issue from the foam hit, was reassigned,

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
along with several other top shuttle managers.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
NASA emphasizes that they're not blaming any particular individual,

42:28.000 --> 42:34.000
and says that it's easier to criticize after the fact than to make real-time decisions.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Best guess.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
When do you flag it?

42:37.000 --> 42:42.000
The answer is as soon as we can do so safely, we've got to find first what the problem was and we're really close.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
It's getting very, very close.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
But can the shuttle be made fail safe?

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
After all, you're harnessing 23 times the power of the Hoover Dam

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
and flying nine times faster than a rifle bullet.

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
We believe that the shuttle can be made reasonably safe to fly.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
It'll never be safe.

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
If you don't fail, you haven't pushed it to a limit.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
For John Clark, these plasma scarred mementos from his wife Laurel,

43:22.000 --> 43:29.000
recovered in the wreckage, aren't a sign of failure, but a badge of honor.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
I'm glad she got to do what she loved to do.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
Was it worth a life?

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
It's the loss is huge for us.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
My son not having a mom, he not having a wife.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
I think in reality, though, to be able to live your dream,

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
is worth a life.

43:49.000 --> 43:54.000
And she's a source of inspiration to our son forever and ever.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
He will have this sense of pride that my mom gave her all,

43:58.000 --> 44:03.000
gave her life in the pursuit of a dream that others could benefit from that.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
It's a precious thing.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
One critical question might something have been done

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
to rescue the astronauts.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
Some now say maybe that question of whether the crew could have been saved

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
when we come back.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
You're a survenge.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
Thanks Jim.

45:23.000 --> 45:30.000
Is the worry of West Nile virus sending your outdoor activities indoors?

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
Take back your backyard with off-hanging mosquito lantern.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
The candle activates the repellent.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
The candle is a little bit more than a candle.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
The candle activates the repellent pad,

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
which protects an area 15 times greater than citronella candles.

45:46.000 --> 45:51.000
Off-hanging mosquito lantern keeps bugs off.

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
Bring the same glowing protection to your Decker patio with off-maskido lamp.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
Hey, Bob.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
You get a new haircut?

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
No.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Hey, Bob.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Hey.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
Did you miss weight?

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Did you jack a bump?

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Nope.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
What's different?

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
He finally asked his doctor about Niagara.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
Ask your doctor and see the difference.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
We're here to learn how to trust our wireless phones,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
which is hard because we've all been hurt before.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
Johnny, we're accepting that our phones are unreliable.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
We're here and not over there.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000

At Philip Morris, USA,

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
we understand that people want to know where we stand

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
on important tobacco issues.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
On our website, you can find out.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
For example, we agree that there is no safe cigarette.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
Cigarette smoking is addictive and causes serious diseases,

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
including lung cancer, heart disease, and emphysema.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
The only proven way to reduce the health risks of smoking is to quit.

The best place for drama on Saturday night is pregnant.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
ABC Saturday, 10-9 central.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
Every morning, the president reads one report first.

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
This top secret document updates all threats against America.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
This report is called the Threat Matrix.

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
ABC presents a powerful new drama about our team protecting America.

48:39.000 --> 48:44.000
Brad Matrix comes in Thursdays this fall's ABC.

48:44.000 --> 48:56.000
It goes without saying that NASA would have done anything possible to save the Columbia astronauts.

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
Had the extent of damage to the shuttle been known.

49:00.000 --> 49:06.000
But it is accepted here that neither rescue of the astronauts nor repair of the shuttle in space could have succeeded.

49:06.000 --> 49:14.000
Which is why many were surprised when the investigating board suggested that attempting a rescue might have been an option.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
Really?

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
It's a haunting question for the astronaut families.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
Is there any way Columbia's crew could have repaired the damage?

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
Or if not, could they have been rescued?

49:30.000 --> 49:36.000
If something could have been done, then all of a sudden it's not just a golden opportunity that was missed.

49:36.000 --> 49:43.000
It actually is a very, very serious failure of the system.

49:43.000 --> 49:54.000
That's why the investigative board asked NASA to look back at what might have been done if, if they had known early enough, the Columbia was in danger.

49:55.000 --> 50:02.000
They came up with a rescue scenario. NASA would launch another shuttle, Atlantis, to rendezvous with Columbia.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
The two ships would orbit as close as 50 feet apart, their open payload bay doors facing each other.

50:07.000 --> 50:17.000
A tethered astronaut would perform a carefully choreographed spacewalk carrying extra spacesuits to Columbia's crew and then escorting them two at a time back to Atlantis.

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
Now empty, the Columbia would be crashed into the ocean by remote control.

50:22.000 --> 50:27.000
This would have been a very, very risky operation with a limited chance of success.

50:27.000 --> 50:32.000
We brought together three NASA legends to ask what might have been done.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
All right, let's get to meet.

50:35.000 --> 50:42.000
Story Muskray flew six shuttle missions and performed a spectacular spacewalk to repair the Hubble Telescope.

50:42.000 --> 50:50.000
Commander Charlie Bolden flew four shuttle missions including one on Columbia before becoming a top NASA safety official.

50:51.000 --> 51:01.000
And Jerry Griffin, former director of the Johnson Space Center, was a flight director and mission control for Apollo 13, the legendary flight, where a seemingly doomed crew was saved.

51:01.000 --> 51:13.000
I'm starting with the premise that alarm bells have been set off and there is a concern that this crew is in danger and at that point, with that what if? What do you do?

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
It take a walk. I say it's simple.

51:16.000 --> 51:24.000
For story Muskray, it is inconceivable that NASA did not consider sending an astronaut on a spacewalk to look at the damage.

51:24.000 --> 51:29.000
Any breach in the wing might have been small, but he says they would have seen it.

51:29.000 --> 51:36.000
You come up with a choreography to dance to do it. Over 30 years, I have designed and developed over 100 spacewalks.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
This is the easiest one that I ever dealt with.

51:40.000 --> 51:48.000
I could put an astronaut eyes four feet below the leading edge of the wing and sweep those eyes along the whole thing.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
You could see something that's high.

51:50.000 --> 51:57.000
Of course. Basically, I would put it right here in front of a human eye right there.

51:57.000 --> 52:06.000
But Charlie Bolden says it is not that simple. If you do not know to look specifically at the leading edge or RCC.

52:06.000 --> 52:14.000
I never suspected in my wildest imagination that anything would have either penetrated or caused damage to the RCC.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
So I would have never looked there to be quite honest.

52:16.000 --> 52:23.000
But even if the trained spacewalkers aboard Columbia, Michael Anderson or Dave Brown had seen the damage, could they have repaired it?

52:23.000 --> 52:31.000
Intuitively, and all I know about is there is no repair possible. It's a rescue. You try a rescue.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Yes. You must.

52:33.000 --> 52:38.000
But few in NASA or in the astronaut community think rescue was realistic.

52:38.000 --> 52:49.000
Even if Columbia's crew took extreme measures to conserve oxygen, the shuttle Atlantis would have had to been rushed into orbit, violating NASA's own safety procedures.

52:49.000 --> 52:57.000
I just would not hurry that process to the point where I thought I was iffy on launching that second vehicle.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
I think it would be putting four more lives at risk and another orbiter at risk.

53:01.000 --> 53:11.000
As a manager, what do I have to have to be convinced to do this? I need to understand what damage to Columbia in the first place and why.

53:13.000 --> 53:20.000
Let me take you to the what if that I think everybody in the country has thought about.

53:20.000 --> 53:26.000
You have determined that a rescue mission or that a repair will not work.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Do you tell the crew?

53:29.000 --> 53:38.000
I've agonized over this. I still don't know. If I would have wanted to have been told that we don't think you're going to make it.

53:38.000 --> 53:49.000
We seldom ever held anything back from the crew that we knew for certain. If there was something that we had looked at and that we were very concerned about, I would tell them that.

53:49.000 --> 53:59.000
But I would also give them in this case, the Columbia case, is that we think you're okay. They obviously did. I wasn't there, but they obviously thought they were okay.

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
The astronauts' families seemed content that their loved ones didn't know.

54:08.000 --> 54:17.000
Hindsight is great. We can go back and say, oh, we could do this now or maybe we should have done this, but at the time nobody knew that.

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
And so it doesn't make any difference at this point. I'm glad he didn't know.

54:22.000 --> 54:35.000
Whether they told them or not while they were on orbit doesn't really change the outcome of what happened. He knew more than I did about the risk, but yet he wanted to do it. He felt like they were contributing and he wanted to be a part of that.

54:38.000 --> 54:55.000
My personal feeling is that I am very satisfied that the way it is played out, that they didn't know. They were successful in the mission in every way except that it didn't get home.

54:55.000 --> 55:17.000
Many of the astronauts' families told us the one thing they're sure of is that their loved ones would want the shuttle program to continue that this disaster should in no way limit NASA's exploration of space.

55:18.000 --> 55:26.000
When we come back, Columbia Final Mission continues with some thoughts on the future of America's space program.

55:56.000 --> 56:06.000
I have lost over 50 pounds on the slimfast plan.

56:06.000 --> 56:13.000
I wasted way too much time being fed. Look at me. It's about feeling good and having energy.

56:13.000 --> 56:23.000
Anybody who's got a taste bud will find something they like. I lost over 50 pounds on the slimfast plan. Don't wait another day. Do it now.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
Success after success after success after success.

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
At Office Depot, you'll find all the school supplies your child needs to achieve success.

56:33.000 --> 56:47.000
This proves the entire story into my measure is discovered in New Galaxy named Prima Mother.

56:47.000 --> 56:55.000
Of course, some of it is up to him. Office Depot, because how you prepare your kids for school can have a lot to do with how they actually do in school.

56:56.000 --> 57:02.000
You know how you always say you could make a meal just out of our soft garlic breadsticks, fresh hot soups and crisp garden salad.

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
You can. The unlimited soup salad and breadsticks lunch. 595, that olive garden.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
Good idea. Great meal.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
North can give our H.A.A. as much as wrinkles.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
Loss of firmness.

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
Nutrigena visibly firm. The only moisturizer that replenishes copper.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
The collagen building mineral is essential for firm skin.

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
Want to be firmer here? Here. Here? I do. Nutrigena visibly firm.

57:32.000 --> 57:39.000
Very shortly, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board will deliver its final report on the Shuttle disaster.

57:39.000 --> 57:48.000
That report will come down very hard on NASA, saying that shuttle managers had grown complacent about foam hits over the years.

57:48.000 --> 57:55.000
That on this flight they had failed to seriously consider the possibility of damage to the leading edge of the Shuttle's wing.

57:55.000 --> 58:00.000
And that overall NASA's safety program had become an empty shell.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
They will also ask some basic questions about the Shuttle program.

58:03.000 --> 58:10.000
Whether the Shuttle has outlived its usefulness. What is the next generation of space vehicles? And where do we go from here?

58:10.000 --> 58:15.000
Good questions. Now NASA says it can fix the hardware and get the Shuttle flying again early next year.

58:16.000 --> 58:23.000
But the Columbia disaster has given a pause for people to consider where do we go from here?

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
It is a question that ought to be on the National Agenda.

58:27.000 --> 58:34.000
I'm Charles Gibson at the Kennedy Space Center. Thanks for watching and for all of us at ABC News. Good night.

59:15.000 --> 59:27.000
This has been a presentation of ABC News. More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source.
