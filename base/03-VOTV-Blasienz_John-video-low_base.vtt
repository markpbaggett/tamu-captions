WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.140
and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:29.140 --> 00:33.780
Tom Tom Turboville. It's a simple fact that World War II could not have been

00:33.780 --> 00:38.460
thought much less one without naval construction battalions better known as

00:38.460 --> 00:42.860
C-Bees. Today you'll meet John Blazons of Bryan but I dare say that many of you

00:42.860 --> 00:47.860
already know him. After all he has lived all but ten of his 82 years in Bryan.

00:47.860 --> 00:52.700
Born in Bryan, proud member of Stephen F Austin High School class of 1942.

00:52.700 --> 00:58.660
Aggie class of 1947 and a proud sailor with the 105th C-Bees serving the

00:58.660 --> 01:02.300
Pacific campaign at Australia, New Guinea and the Philippines at the late

01:02.300 --> 01:05.980
take off. It's a pleasure to have you on Veterans of the Valley. I want to talk

01:05.980 --> 01:10.460
about a man who probably knows Bryan as well as anybody. You were born here. I

01:10.460 --> 01:14.260
know your dad was in the grocery business and also in the cotton business here.

01:14.260 --> 01:18.500
Born in Bryan and spent like we said all but ten years in Bryan. Talk about

01:18.500 --> 01:22.900
what Bryan, Texas, was like back in the the 1930s I guess when you were just a

01:22.900 --> 01:28.380
young kid growing up. What was the town like? Well Bryan was Main Street. A few

01:28.380 --> 01:35.940
businesses on Bryan Street. Basically everything went up and down Main Street.

01:35.940 --> 01:42.420
All the grocery stores were there as well. There's the clothing stores and

01:42.420 --> 01:48.980
the drug stores just about anything that you wanted at that time. So what we know

01:48.980 --> 01:52.780
is downtown Bryan now that's just where practically all the commerce was. When

01:52.780 --> 01:55.820
you wanted to buy something go to the grocery store, go to a movie, go get

01:55.820 --> 02:00.220
clothes, you went to downtown Bryan. That's true. You parked at the curb and walked

02:00.220 --> 02:04.760
into the bin as you wanted to deal with and then you drove two blocks down the

02:04.760 --> 02:08.780
street and parked at the curb again. Right. Right. And Bryan as we know it today

02:08.780 --> 02:12.660
wasn't anything like it then. It was pretty much a shrunk version of what we

02:12.660 --> 02:18.300
see now because the paved roads were sort of few and far between. Right? That's

02:18.300 --> 02:24.700
correct. Texas Avenue was Highway 6 and there was a paved street that went west to

02:24.700 --> 02:29.100
serve Boo Elementary School and there was a paved street that went east to serve

02:29.100 --> 02:33.300
Travis Elementary School. Right. That was pretty near it. So if you wanted to get

02:33.300 --> 02:37.940
from Bryan say a downtown Bryan to Texas A&M you would take Highway 6 up to

02:37.940 --> 02:41.540
what we know is the as the bins right now and then that would go on to

02:41.540 --> 02:45.100
College Avenue on to campus. That's how you got to campus right? College Avenue

02:45.100 --> 02:51.300
Old College Road and what is now a well-run road to get to campus. Right. Of course

02:51.300 --> 02:55.420
you had Texas A&M on the on the other side and then you had Bryan. What was

02:55.420 --> 03:01.500
how did the how did the citizenry and all of that deal with Texas A&M?

03:01.500 --> 03:07.020
Obviously Texas A&M was a big industry there just like it is now. Yes and of

03:07.020 --> 03:12.780
course Bryan probably felt then much like College Station does now. The home of

03:12.780 --> 03:18.060
Texas A&M. Right. Right. Right. It was the agriculture and mechanical college. You

03:18.060 --> 03:21.740
said that your dad was in the cotton business. Cotton was a big industry back

03:21.740 --> 03:26.260
then in in Bryan and that had a lot to do with the railroad I guess right? Well

03:26.260 --> 03:34.980
cotton was the valley the branches bottom the farmers raised mostly cotton as

03:34.980 --> 03:41.460
far as a pay. Right. Right. Right. You went to Stephen F. Austin as a matter of

03:41.460 --> 03:46.300
fact this this past summer it's actually after we're taping this but before

03:46.300 --> 03:51.820
it's airing on TV in June you had a reunion at the class of 1942 of Stephen

03:51.820 --> 03:55.300
F. Austin high school. A lot of people of course obviously know that was the

03:55.300 --> 04:00.140
pre of what we know now is Bryan high school. Talk a little bit about Stephen

04:00.140 --> 04:04.700
F. Austin back in the back in the 40s obviously it was a it was a wonderful

04:04.700 --> 04:09.300
school a lot of great memories. Well yes Stephen F. Austin was a new high school

04:09.300 --> 04:16.620
and the more junior high school originated in the original high school

04:16.620 --> 04:21.600
building so that when I went Stephen F. Austin was only about three three

04:21.600 --> 04:28.700
years old and the facility is today. Right. And we had the three classes and lots

04:28.700 --> 04:33.740
of football support of course that was still the number one sport. Speaking of

04:33.740 --> 04:38.100
football you were the class of 1942 but you actually didn't receive your

04:38.100 --> 04:41.980
diploma until after the fall of 1942 and that had something to do with

04:41.980 --> 04:45.940
football and your desire to play quarterback that last year in the fall of

04:45.940 --> 04:51.020
42 sort of talk about how that worked. Well it was just fact that you could play

04:51.020 --> 04:59.340
high school football until you were 18 and so I was 17 and was eligible to play

04:59.340 --> 05:07.820
another semester. Right. Did not graduate in May of 42 but came back that

05:07.820 --> 05:11.180
fall and took one took an English class or something like that or took a

05:11.180 --> 05:13.980
couple of classes in the fall so you could be eligible for football right.

05:13.980 --> 05:19.660
Yes English was one of the state mandated courses right if you didn't have all

05:19.660 --> 05:23.260
your English credits you couldn't graduate. Right so you waited to the fall to

05:23.260 --> 05:26.540
take that so you could play football and then and then finished and I think you

05:26.540 --> 05:30.020
told me you were the first T-formation quarterback of Brian of Brian

05:30.020 --> 05:35.860
higher Stephen F. Austin right. Yes that's true. That's great. Right after you

05:35.860 --> 05:39.540
graduated from from high school you you entered Texas A&M so actually that

05:39.540 --> 05:43.780
would have been in the in the spring semester I guess earlier January of

05:43.780 --> 05:48.540
of 1943 that's when you enter Texas A&M. That's correct yeah yeah. I went one

05:48.540 --> 05:52.620
semester to Texas A&M and then the course we were already involved in the

05:52.620 --> 05:57.060
war this being in 1943 then talk about your desire to enter the service and

05:57.060 --> 06:01.580
particularly the Navy and you sort of had the timing was such to where if you

06:01.580 --> 06:05.260
wanted to be in the Navy you had to go to Houston on a particular time and

06:05.260 --> 06:09.300
and say hello to the draft office sort of talk about your desire to be in the

06:09.300 --> 06:17.780
Navy. Well at 18 you became draft eligible and we had to we looked at the

06:17.780 --> 06:22.140
military and some of us wanted to be in the Navy and others wanted to wait until

06:22.140 --> 06:26.980
they were drafted and I was one of those that had the desire to be in the Navy.

06:26.980 --> 06:31.060
Right so your dad took you to Houston on the day that when the draft the draft

06:31.060 --> 06:34.740
these were being put in the Navy so you timed it that way on purpose so that

06:34.740 --> 06:40.500
that's correct that's correct. Right and tell us where you were sent initially I

06:40.500 --> 06:43.700
know you were sent to the East Coast and then a long long trip to the West Coast

06:43.700 --> 06:47.860
so after you you up sort of talk about your training before you went overseas.

06:47.860 --> 06:54.420
Well there was a CB training base at Williamsburg Virginia right on the

06:54.420 --> 07:01.140
Chesapeake Bay and we were sent there for what they call boot camp still and

07:01.540 --> 07:07.820
then we were assigned to battalions and moved out to different parts of the

07:07.820 --> 07:11.460
world. Right so one and tell you went to Virginia that you realized that you

07:11.460 --> 07:15.260
were going to be assigned to the construction battalion and that you're you were

07:15.260 --> 07:20.740
going to be a CB right? Yes I was told that was a CB before yeah for we left Texas

07:20.740 --> 07:24.020
before you left Texas so you knew what you were in for and that you would be

07:24.020 --> 07:28.620
there. A three-week train ride from Virginia to California and they took quite a

07:28.620 --> 07:34.380
route. You remember that three-week train ride a lot don't you? Yes I suppose it

07:34.380 --> 07:39.500
was for security purposes but we went up into Ohio and back down to the Texas

07:39.500 --> 07:44.660
Panhandle and then the train went all the way to South Chicago and then back

07:44.660 --> 07:49.300
down to New Mexico and finally up through Salt Lake City and crossed the

07:49.300 --> 07:56.100
mountains there into California. Three weeks on the train yeah that was quite

07:56.100 --> 08:02.300
a ride and quite an indirect route to get there. Port Wainibi I believe it is in

08:02.300 --> 08:07.420
Southern California which is a base that is known for its training of

08:07.420 --> 08:12.500
CB's is one of the largest CB centers are the largest on the West Coast. Talk

08:12.500 --> 08:17.140
about that and it still exists with the museum there I believe. Well that was the

08:17.140 --> 08:24.700
base for our battalion organized itself in a big manner and went through

08:24.740 --> 08:31.180
typical training. We had all the rumors of going to Alaska or going to South

08:31.180 --> 08:40.340
Pacific at a bounded and I guess every military organization but we were being

08:40.340 --> 08:45.420
prepared. John I want you to talk about about the CB's I have always been

08:45.420 --> 08:49.140
personally just fascinated with the work that they did while some people might

08:49.140 --> 08:56.940
not consider it the big action spot of the war. It's true I mean the work

08:56.940 --> 09:00.380
could not have been fought could not have been won without what the CB's did

09:00.380 --> 09:04.780
especially in the Pacific theater and the Pacific campaign because you all

09:04.780 --> 09:08.860
built stuff. You all made something out of nothing as far as as far as a

09:08.860 --> 09:13.860
runways as far as a quatsit huts like you talk about bridges, piers and things

09:13.860 --> 09:17.700
like that. Talk about the CB's to the people that may not be familiar with

09:17.700 --> 09:23.660
exactly what the role of the CB's was in World War II. Well in an island war of

09:23.660 --> 09:32.740
course each each island had its individual problems and CB's went in and our

09:32.740 --> 09:41.500
job was to prepare air strips or to prepare buildings for training or for

09:41.500 --> 09:51.680
and some hospitals. We built our battalion built a base for PT boats in the

09:51.680 --> 09:59.780
Philippines and so we did a little bit of all kinds of construction work and that

09:59.780 --> 10:06.900
permitted those involved in the actual combat to go about their business without

10:06.900 --> 10:11.380
worrying about details maybe. Right. Well planes needed to run away to

10:11.380 --> 10:15.660
land on and once they got there they needed a place to live. Storage was a big

10:15.660 --> 10:19.940
deal obviously because there was equipment constantly being supplied to the

10:19.940 --> 10:23.780
Pacific theater where you're going to put all this stuff. One of the things you

10:23.780 --> 10:26.620
were involved in was the building of quatsit huts and not just for people to

10:26.620 --> 10:29.940
live but you talked about how they were strung together to make warehouses so

10:29.940 --> 10:35.940
you were having into construction right. Yes well I was assigned to a crew that

10:35.940 --> 10:41.540
was primarily involved in building quatsit huts. We built small ones for office

10:41.540 --> 10:48.140
recorders we built large ones for people to live in the crews and everything

10:48.140 --> 10:54.020
are we built tied them together and a way to make some very enormous warehouse

10:54.020 --> 10:59.660
facilities because the supplies that were coming to the Pacific was very

10:59.660 --> 11:05.960
enormous. When we went to the Philippines I think that there were over 150

11:05.960 --> 11:12.500
ships in Lady Gough at one time right at the time of the re invasion. Right.

11:12.500 --> 11:16.580
Right. And when we're talking about supplies we're not just talking about guns

11:16.580 --> 11:21.100
and ammo and things like that. We're talking about tanks and trucks and and the

11:21.100 --> 11:26.140
vehicles that it took to to fight the war. I mean we're talking about large

11:26.140 --> 11:31.580
large equipment that you all had to deal with in fine place for. Yes that and food.

11:31.580 --> 11:37.860
An enormous amount of food had to be brought in to serve our troops. Right. Right.

11:37.860 --> 11:42.060
And this is food I guess that you had to make sure that that didn't spoil and had

11:42.060 --> 11:46.460
to be properly cared for and all that and feed the troops. So it's just a

11:46.460 --> 11:51.780
fascinating part of the war the the Navy CBCs. When you left California initially

11:51.780 --> 11:54.780
I want to back up a little bit you first went to down south to Australia and

11:54.780 --> 11:59.140
then straight north of Australia to New Guinea before you went to the

11:59.140 --> 12:02.380
Philippines. So sort of talk about your route from California and what you did

12:02.380 --> 12:09.260
at each place. Well rather than a convoy our troop ship was alone so it went as

12:09.260 --> 12:14.860
far south as it could reasonably go and then in order to avoid Japanese

12:14.860 --> 12:20.500
submarines and then circle around and then came back north and landed on the

12:20.500 --> 12:27.580
east coast of Australia or at least we anchored for about a month before

12:27.580 --> 12:34.540
they moved us on north to New Guinea. Right. Right. And of course at that time

12:34.540 --> 12:42.460
combat was still underway on the island of New Guinea and then when they got

12:42.460 --> 12:48.700
ready to recapture the Philippine islands well then we were loaded on to

12:48.700 --> 12:55.300
transports that had all of our supplies and equipment on them and we had

12:55.300 --> 13:01.260
it north and ended up at Lady Gulf on the same day that General Mike Arthur

13:01.260 --> 13:06.180
returned. I see I see. The late take off obviously a hotspot of the of the

13:06.180 --> 13:10.060
Pacific campaign and while you say you weren't directly involved in combat

13:10.060 --> 13:13.260
operations you could you could hear it from where you were right. That's

13:13.260 --> 13:22.980
correct. They were pretty close to us anyway. Right. Right. You said that one of

13:22.980 --> 13:27.580
the things that your unit did was build piers and you believe that possibly

13:27.580 --> 13:32.480
where you were may have been involved were former president John F. Kennedy and

13:32.480 --> 13:36.220
his PT both might have docked because he was in the Philippines at one time in

13:36.220 --> 13:41.180
his in his service right. Yes there was a PT base between the island of

13:41.180 --> 13:48.140
Latia and the island of Samar. The ocean channel there was pretty narrow and

13:48.140 --> 13:54.580
PT boats should come in there and dock and resurface and make plans to go back

13:54.580 --> 14:01.820
into the ocean. Right. Right. We've got three photos that Mr. Blazons has

14:01.820 --> 14:06.100
supplied us. These are photos from his home. They want to show you a young John

14:06.100 --> 14:09.900
Blazons at Texas A&M and then later in the Navy and you can see that picture

14:09.900 --> 14:13.260
right there that's is that your senior picture at Texas A&M when we had it

14:13.260 --> 14:18.500
up on the screen and now it has gone away. Oh there we go. There you are back

14:18.500 --> 14:23.020
again. Is that your senior photo at Texas A&M? Well I would more or less say that

14:23.020 --> 14:27.780
was my freshman photo because when after the war I did not have to be in the

14:27.780 --> 14:30.380
core. That's right. That's right. You weren't in the core so that would have been

14:30.380 --> 14:35.740
your your first year that one semester before you went into the Navy. Quite a

14:35.740 --> 14:40.980
good luck in young man. Wow. And then the next photo is a little later when you

14:40.980 --> 14:47.380
were in a Navy photograph so this was taken just a few years later. Yes. Right.

14:47.380 --> 14:53.820
And now we've got a picture of one of your units as you can see we're going to

14:53.820 --> 14:59.700
enlarge that a little bit. You can see that that's from a book sort of an annual

14:59.700 --> 15:05.020
yearbook that was made of the 105th CBC Chief Lamby's crew and I believe you said

15:05.020 --> 15:08.420
that you were on the the back row sort of in the middle. Is that right?

15:08.420 --> 15:11.860
Fourth from the left? Yes. There you are. You have fourth from the left on the

15:11.860 --> 15:16.300
back row. So that was essentially the laboring crew right there that you worked

15:16.300 --> 15:21.540
with? That's correct. That particular time and we were building these all storage

15:21.540 --> 15:26.980
tanks in the Philippines. They were built from sheets of steel which were

15:26.980 --> 15:33.300
connected with nuts and bolts and washers. And that's one of the storage tanks

15:33.300 --> 15:37.020
that you're sitting in that you're standing in front of. Right. And these

15:37.020 --> 15:42.780
storage tanks, I know you talked to me earlier about a lot of the

15:42.780 --> 15:47.980
storage that you all did was oil and things like that and that was kind of a

15:47.980 --> 15:51.460
dicey situation in case the enemy should come over. You didn't want that

15:51.460 --> 15:55.660
that oil sitting out there because that would have been a bomb way to go off.

15:55.660 --> 16:03.020
Well that's probably true although by the time we were building on those the

16:03.020 --> 16:09.020
United States had pretty much air superiority. Right. Right. Right. You were in the

16:09.020 --> 16:11.940
Philippines when the war ended and at that time I believe you said you had your

16:11.940 --> 16:16.180
choice of joining the occupational forces or going home and you decided to go

16:16.180 --> 16:20.940
home and continue your education. Sort of talk about that decision and what

16:20.940 --> 16:26.660
your desires were then. Well I guess at that age I still

16:26.660 --> 16:33.020
wouldn't 21 and I had been away from home over two years and I got a little

16:33.020 --> 16:39.100
home sick as well as wanting to get back into school. Indeed. And all you were

16:39.100 --> 16:42.820
overseas for two years. So you had served a good service there from December

16:42.820 --> 16:47.420
43 to December of 1945 and you came back home and you went right back into

16:47.420 --> 16:51.540
Texas A&M while you were class of 47 you ended up not getting out until

16:51.540 --> 16:57.220
1950 because of your your war service and you took your CB experience and went

16:57.220 --> 17:00.380
right into a civil engineering. Is that right? Talk about that and what your

17:00.380 --> 17:05.940
career was after that. Well that basically that's one of the life's events that

17:05.940 --> 17:11.580
made me decide what I wanted to do and I came back and said I wanted a major

17:11.580 --> 17:16.700
in civil engineering. Right. Which I did. And you helped build highways. Is that

17:16.700 --> 17:20.220
what you worked for the highway department for several years? I worked for

17:20.220 --> 17:25.820
Texas Highway Department or now the Department of Transportation for 37 years.

17:25.820 --> 17:29.700
It's been eight years in Brinham? Yeah. Talk about what you did then. Well I was in

17:29.700 --> 17:36.420
the residency there and we were contracting and constructing various highways

17:36.420 --> 17:41.460
and Washington County at that time. Right including 290 that goes around Brinham

17:41.460 --> 17:48.860
you know. That's correct. Then I came to Brinham and I was made the district

17:48.860 --> 17:53.580
construction engineer in the Brinham district which encompasses 10 counties

17:53.580 --> 17:58.380
that surround Brinham County. One thing we haven't talked about is your

17:58.380 --> 18:02.300
athletic career. We talked about that you played quarterback for Stephen F. Austin

18:02.300 --> 18:06.140
your senior year but then you became a baseball man as a matter of fact you're

18:06.140 --> 18:11.380
wearing your baseball tie today. You played for Marty Keros, Texas A&M

18:11.380 --> 18:16.740
team I believe for a year and you were what you described yourself as a as a

18:16.740 --> 18:21.180
scrub but you were a middle-end fielder and so talk about your experiences in

18:21.180 --> 18:25.500
baseball which later became actually a semi-pro career in Brinham. So talk

18:25.500 --> 18:32.260
about John Blazons and his baseball career. Well I had played baseball with

18:32.260 --> 18:40.500
local teams in Bryan while I was at A&M and as I mentioned before one year in

18:40.500 --> 18:45.420
1948 Marty Keros said he was shorthanded and he put out a call and it was kind of

18:45.420 --> 18:51.060
like the 12th man. A couple hundred of us came out and we worked out for two or

18:51.060 --> 18:55.620
three weeks at different times and he chose about four of us to be on the baseball

18:55.620 --> 19:00.060
squad. This is sort of a 12th man story that few people know about is the call

19:00.060 --> 19:03.420
for the baseball team and you say a couple hundred showed up and it just sort of

19:03.420 --> 19:07.060
got paired down and paired down and you were one of four that made the eventual

19:07.060 --> 19:12.700
cut. I was one of the lucky ones and I enjoyed the experience of being on the

19:12.700 --> 19:17.500
NM baseball team and we get season tickets and go to all the games we can.

19:17.500 --> 19:22.700
Now this was back when the baseball field was in essentially what the parking lot

19:22.700 --> 19:28.020
of Kyle Field is now right? That's correct. Yeah and then your baseball career

19:28.020 --> 19:33.020
continued somewhat when you went to Brinham because you played for the semi-pro

19:33.020 --> 19:36.680
team there in Brinham the Brinham Lions right? That's correct they had the

19:36.680 --> 19:44.400
semi-pro team there but mostly local Brinham men and boys and we played

19:44.400 --> 19:51.000
different teams all around Texas from Houston primarily and teams like

19:51.000 --> 19:57.440
Gittings and the Grange and at that time they all had had baseball teams. Right

19:57.440 --> 20:01.840
right and there was a fellow on this Brinham team who had a sister named

20:01.840 --> 20:06.280
Madeline. Yeah yeah that worked out pretty good for you. And they sure did. I've

20:06.280 --> 20:12.160
been married to Madeline for 56 years. That's right so you met her she was

20:12.160 --> 20:16.200
she was a sister of one of your one of your teammates. That's correct. So you

20:16.200 --> 20:21.880
made and you all have been married for some 56 years now and you still love

20:21.880 --> 20:25.880
baseball you still love I think you said you even pitched for your for your

20:25.880 --> 20:31.360
church when you were 65 in the softball league right? So it's obviously a lot

20:31.360 --> 20:35.680
slower pitch is that right? You and Madeline were married talk a little bit about

20:35.680 --> 20:40.120
your family I know you have a couple of kids and and and grandkids talk about

20:40.120 --> 20:44.000
your kids and what they do you are fortunate in that your kids and your grandkids

20:44.000 --> 20:50.400
both live here in the area right? That's correct. Our son David has a small

20:50.400 --> 20:55.720
construction company called Braco Blaco I beg you put him, Blaco construction and

20:55.720 --> 21:03.120
he does work in the local area and they he and his wife Beth have one son Andrew

21:03.120 --> 21:11.880
who will be 18 this year right and then our daughter Sarah as she's an

21:11.880 --> 21:16.440
Aggie sociality graduate and she works with Brian independent school district

21:16.440 --> 21:27.000
right and she and her husband have two children read who is 16 and Melissa who is

21:27.000 --> 21:32.720
12 right and so they're both in the community reading Melissa or swimmers and

21:32.720 --> 21:38.440
they do competitive swimming and so I think you said your daughter with the BISD

21:38.440 --> 21:41.200
is involved with a lot of the families that are still in the area that

21:41.200 --> 21:45.160
worry about you ease from Katrina so that takes up a lot of her time right? She's

21:45.160 --> 21:51.640
involved with some of those who are students at Brian Hasky. Right I want to rewind

21:51.640 --> 21:55.800
a little bit some of your times at Texas A&M that you talked about you can

21:55.800 --> 21:59.840
recall December 7th 1941 you were 16 you were in high school and what did your

21:59.840 --> 22:04.300
dad say to you about that time it turned out to be a profitable statement

22:04.300 --> 22:09.560
or he turned out to be a profit on the statement. Yes that's true when we heard

22:09.560 --> 22:15.240
about it that day and he looked at me and and said if this lasts long enough

22:15.240 --> 22:21.040
you'll get in you'll be involved and he was right and he was right indeed you

22:21.040 --> 22:24.800
were involved in the war when you when you were in high school you did come to

22:24.800 --> 22:29.520
A&M campus every once in a while to ten football games like you said you

22:29.520 --> 22:33.440
were when the not-whole league came up you were you were able to watch

22:33.440 --> 22:36.400
Aggie football games what do you remember about Aggie football back when you

22:36.400 --> 22:41.400
were in high school? Well for us Aggie football was the only football at that

22:41.400 --> 22:49.560
time exactly we watched them and supported them strongly right and I don't

22:49.560 --> 22:54.320
know whether the worship is the right word we worship the stars that came up

22:54.320 --> 22:58.920
along the days 1930's Todd and John Kimbrue 39 they won the National

22:58.920 --> 23:03.840
Champion Championship so you were yeah yeah you were here at that time you tell

23:03.840 --> 23:08.400
me a funny story about when Franklin D Roosevelt came to college station and

23:08.400 --> 23:12.640
came to Kyle Field and and sort of they sort of recruited people to make it

23:12.640 --> 23:17.920
look crowded at Kyle Field right? Right he made a speech there and I think

23:17.920 --> 23:22.880
in Tarsedia Bryan closed down just about and everybody went out to Kyle Field

23:22.880 --> 23:29.600
and it made it look like there was a crowd in the grandstand and you were one of

23:29.600 --> 23:34.720
them there it was there was in the background right? Right right the Navy

23:34.720 --> 23:41.000
C-beats again it's a facet of the of the of the service that I'm fascinated

23:41.000 --> 23:45.840
with you're obviously being a member of the C-beats is something that you're

23:45.840 --> 23:48.840
you're very proud of because it obviously gave you your career gave you the

23:48.840 --> 23:53.880
skills that that that gave your career sort of talk about your deep

23:53.880 --> 23:59.140
feelings of your lifelong feelings about this this group and the people? Well

23:59.140 --> 24:06.320
it's sometimes difficult to express how you feel about an organization these

24:06.320 --> 24:17.520
were people who came from all parts of life the leaders of the C-beats were

24:17.520 --> 24:23.980
experienced construction people right? You mentioned chief lambing who was from

24:23.980 --> 24:29.760
Lufkin he had been in the construction business for a number of years and so

24:29.760 --> 24:37.560
those of us who were came in and say through the draft and we were assigned

24:37.560 --> 24:44.000
there to perform the labor but there were a lot of those young men who became

24:44.000 --> 24:51.680
accomplished and skilled at certain amounts of parts of the work some of us got

24:51.680 --> 24:56.040
a hold of construction equipment we had never seen right when we were building

24:56.040 --> 25:00.680
the peers you know there were a lot of drills and jackhammers and solves that

25:00.680 --> 25:07.200
that went on and and the young guys were the ones that had to perform that

25:07.200 --> 25:16.960
work right so we've been I have been proud that that the organization has set up

25:16.960 --> 25:23.160
these museums their museums for all facets of the military service around

25:23.160 --> 25:30.600
the Mississippi and in California now there are CB museums which have

25:30.600 --> 25:37.680
recorded some of the work that the C-beats did right and it wasn't much I

25:37.680 --> 25:44.280
like John Wayne's movie where they got into a battle but occasionally it was

25:44.280 --> 25:48.080
frightening yeah well I think it's just incredible some of the pictures that I've

25:48.080 --> 25:53.200
seen especially in the Philippines and and Okinawa and Guadalcanal where they

25:53.200 --> 25:57.560
would take a landscape that was just forest and they could just flatten that out

25:57.560 --> 26:02.760
and make runways that the biggest bombers could land on it's almost mind

26:02.760 --> 26:08.160
boggling what the CVs could do with their skills and and not a whole lot of

26:08.160 --> 26:15.000
equipment but just with their skills it's entirely fascinating well that's sort

26:15.000 --> 26:21.600
of thing kind of creates pride in an organization absolutely always valued

26:21.600 --> 26:29.360
that experience growing up that's the way to put it and making some life

26:29.360 --> 26:34.560
decision life decisions but John Blazons were out of time but thank you for

26:34.560 --> 26:38.320
your service and thank you for being here and as a proud Navy CB and thank

26:38.320 --> 26:42.960

the city what it is thank you very much thank you for the opportunity all right
