00:30.000 --> 00:41.840
Hello and welcome to the Veterans of the Valley. I'm Tom Turbiville. Last week you met

00:41.840 --> 00:47.280
first Sergeant Jeffrey Bailey of Bryant, a 20-year Army veteran with a remarkable story

00:47.280 --> 00:54.280
to tell. Not just of his service in Germany, Korea, Alaska, two tours of Vietnam, and

00:54.280 --> 00:59.440
three weeks in Southside Chicago that he will never forget. Today he'll talk about that

00:59.440 --> 01:04.640
and his second hitch in Vietnam, where he returned home with a second purple heart and

01:04.640 --> 01:09.640
a silver star, the third highest award given by the military. So please welcome back

01:09.640 --> 01:14.520
to Veterans of the Valley, first Sergeant Jeffrey Bailey of Bryant. Jeffrey, it's great

01:14.520 --> 01:20.200
to be back. A remarkable story that you told us last week of your tours in Germany and

01:20.200 --> 01:27.000
Alaska and going to Vietnam for the first time. Let's move on after your first tour

01:27.040 --> 01:33.040
of Vietnam. You said that you came back to Fort Hood and as a chief tactical instructor,

01:33.040 --> 01:42.640
April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated and talk about how that caused

01:42.640 --> 01:48.640
what you did next and what your next deployment was going to Chicago. How did that all

01:48.640 --> 01:55.880
come about? Okay, first of all I'm glad to be back. Coming out of Vietnam I was assigned

01:55.880 --> 02:02.880
as a chief tactical instructor at the Third Corps NCO Academy. And kind of turning that

02:02.880 --> 02:09.880
down, I chose to go back with the land unit infantry. So I wound up back up there with

02:09.880 --> 02:19.360
a lifelong friend of mine, which is the cease now, first Sergeant Swarthard and others.

02:19.360 --> 02:26.120
And they had just activated this unit and made up primarily of people who could not

02:26.120 --> 02:32.680
would not didn't want to go to Vietnam, want them light infantry units. So we had the

02:32.680 --> 02:39.400
worst or the worst. And the mission, we were just as soon as we began to get personnel

02:39.400 --> 02:47.040
in the primary mission, in addition to being combat ready, became a right control training.

02:47.040 --> 02:56.000
And my company, my battalion was the primary right control organization on post and other

02:56.000 --> 03:04.720
supporting units. And we trained up and got ready to go whenever called out. Our primary

03:04.720 --> 03:12.800
target was New Orleans, followed by Houston. And so for as I could tell those two cities

03:12.800 --> 03:22.360
missed the revolution. That was never any call for troops in either one of those cities.

03:22.360 --> 03:26.760
But after the death of Martin Luther King, we got alerted on the second day or so that

03:26.760 --> 03:33.280
after he was assassinated and we did get the call, but we didn't go to New Orleans.

03:33.280 --> 03:37.840
In fact, we didn't know where the target was. We knew where it should be. You know, it's

03:37.840 --> 03:42.760
a guessing game. New Orleans, Houston, nothing going on either direction. But we were

03:42.760 --> 03:50.800
wound up going to Chicago. This was a notch after we got down the burst from our force base.

03:50.800 --> 03:58.040
And we went and we did the job that we were sent to do.

03:58.040 --> 04:01.760
You flew and I think you said you flew in a 747 passenger.

04:01.760 --> 04:06.320
747. Right. In a passenger jet. That's right. The Army either commended it or leashed or

04:06.320 --> 04:13.880
had on standby. X number 747 schedule moved troops around the country. And we first class

04:13.880 --> 04:21.840
on the 747. If you consider combat loaded, every man has got his basic load of ammunition.

04:21.840 --> 04:31.120
And it wasn't a pleasure, Cruz. You were combat ready. You had your basic load of ammunition,

04:31.120 --> 04:38.960
it's steel pots, flag jackets. You went for, it was a combat situation. So for us, we

04:38.960 --> 04:44.240
were concerned. You've been to Vietnam. You've faced an enemy there. But this, when you're

04:44.240 --> 04:49.360
on that airplane, you're, I guess you're a little bit anticipating what kind of resistance

04:49.360 --> 04:54.640
you're going to be facing in this sort of a situation on an American street in Chicago.

04:54.640 --> 05:01.680
Well, you, I don't know if you have time to do that. It never occurred to me to think of it

05:01.680 --> 05:08.160
in those terms because number one, you, you know what your mission is. It's to control

05:08.160 --> 05:12.160
people. Right. With a minimum amount of force,

05:12.160 --> 05:19.520
incasuatures and stuff like that. But you are armed to the teeth. You've got your M60 machine

05:19.600 --> 05:25.680
guns, your 50 calories. You got everything you need to do this job. And if you're mission oriented

05:27.280 --> 05:32.640
and you have sworn allegiance to those above you, starting with the president of United States,

05:32.640 --> 05:37.840
you're going to carry out the mission. Right. And you don't get a lot of time to pick and choose

05:37.840 --> 05:44.400
your battles or think about whether or not you agree with the decision. The decision, once the

05:44.400 --> 05:51.120
decision is made, the mission becomes mine to execute. And that's all I need to do. Talk

05:51.120 --> 05:58.720
about the mission. What, what did you find when you got to South Side Chicago? Well, okay fine.

05:59.200 --> 06:04.880
But just prior to departing for hood, getting up at four o'clock in the morning,

06:04.880 --> 06:10.080
mustering and drawing your weapon out of armed room, getting your basic load or ammunition on

06:10.400 --> 06:19.600
palli-tied ready to go. I had one man that came to me and said, first, I don't want to go to Chicago.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.760
And I looked at him because I knew exactly where he's coming from. I just said,

06:26.400 --> 06:31.600
now, is it that you don't want to go or you tell him you don't want to go or you're not going?

06:31.600 --> 06:36.560
He said, oh no, no, no, no, I'm saying I don't want to go. If you're telling me to go, I'm going

06:36.560 --> 06:41.040
to do the job I'm assigned. I said, fine. Go over there and report the first starting

06:41.040 --> 06:48.480
swarfer. That's my friend who had the red detachment going to stay at Ford Hood. We got down to Chicago

06:50.480 --> 06:57.840
we flew out of Burstermouth, Ford's base in Austin on the 747s we were talking about.

06:58.240 --> 07:06.240
As we came into Chicago, came into O'Harefield, I remember the city of Paula,

07:06.240 --> 07:12.640
Smokehand over the city at about 3,000 feet. It looks like the whole city is burning down.

07:13.680 --> 07:19.600
We did plane and within an hour we were in Grant Park out on the shores of Lake Michigan.

07:20.560 --> 07:29.200
There was no rats out there. Absolutely none. We set up Bivwak in the park that night and moved

07:29.200 --> 07:35.760
out at 9 o'clock the next morning, downtown Chicago, Southside and that's where the rats were going on.

07:37.280 --> 07:47.040
And that's where our action took place. We got organized within 30 minutes after we got to

07:47.760 --> 07:56.160
within an hour after we moved into, because we moved from Grant Park 9 o'clock the next morning by bus

07:57.600 --> 08:06.640
with escorts you wouldn't believe. Every police officer with a car, MPs with jeeps.

08:08.400 --> 08:15.040
I don't know who they belonged to, but they were there. Shares people, FBI, just about everybody

08:15.040 --> 08:24.640
you could see escorted us downtown to Jackson Park. Which was also my first experience with

08:24.640 --> 08:30.960
organized gangs per se. We talked about the crypts and the bloods with something several years ago

08:30.960 --> 08:37.280
was a problem. They should be introduced to the Blackstone Rangers, the Grand Daddy of some of the

08:37.280 --> 08:48.480
gangs. We de-plained the bus in Jackson Park, formed up in formation and that's the first conflict

08:48.480 --> 08:59.520
right there because hecklers come along and they start harassing the troops, girls and miniskirts

08:59.760 --> 09:09.520
and guys you know. But once you call out one squad, fix bayonets, they break that one up in a hurry

09:09.520 --> 09:14.640
and that was all over. That got their attention. Right. By four o'clock that afternoon we were on the streets

09:14.640 --> 09:24.480
though. Right. And we locked it down. We was on the streets for 32 hours at 100%. We learned a lot of

09:24.800 --> 09:32.880
things. Number one, you can stand. I had a 50 caliber mounted on the top of the building and you can

09:32.880 --> 09:38.720
stand on the top of the building and you can see three quarters of a mile in any direction up and

09:38.720 --> 09:44.960
down the street. You can always tell whether fight or the right is fish to break out because it's

09:44.960 --> 09:51.200
like watching a stream of water. There go two individuals, a third one's on them, four, five, six

09:51.200 --> 09:57.360
and pretty soon it looks like a moving, flowing stream. And all you got to do is cut off that stream

09:57.360 --> 10:04.080
and you disrupt the right. If you give it time, if it's at night and you can't see them that well,

10:04.800 --> 10:10.880
you listen for the breaking glass. When you hear the glass breaking, you know where all the liquor stores

10:10.880 --> 10:15.200
is because that's the first thing you break into. Right. Get the liquor, then we'll get the

10:15.200 --> 10:20.720
drag goods and burn the place down just for the hell of it. Right. Right. But it was a unique experience.

10:21.600 --> 10:28.560
What were your personal thoughts during this time? Dr. King had been assassinated two days before.

10:28.560 --> 10:32.240
What were your personal thoughts? Is a black soldier who embraced Dr. King's

10:34.000 --> 10:40.960
belief of peace? What were your own thoughts and the mission that you were asked to perform?

10:41.920 --> 10:50.320
Okay. You don't with me. You have a lot of time prior to this. By now I probably

10:50.320 --> 10:59.440
been in the Army 15 years. So I've been in this game for a while. I've had time to evaluate all of the

11:01.200 --> 11:07.600
situations, the relationship between races and so forth. So I'm pretty well set at where I'm at.

11:08.560 --> 11:20.880
And you got to realize that growing up in Brothers County, Texas was my idea of a Uper torn race

11:22.560 --> 11:31.600
thing. It wanted to reason why I stayed in the Army was because the, when I was drafted,

11:31.600 --> 11:33.600
first of all, within the Gleck, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that,

11:33.600 --> 11:41.760
in volunteer, I was drafted. But after being in the Army, a, a year, I realized that the playing

11:41.760 --> 11:49.120
field was on the level. But it was certainly so much more level than it was here. And I stayed in.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.840
Because I'm not only could render service to my country, but I could also advance within the

11:55.840 --> 12:02.720
limits of my own ability to a certain extent. So going into there, we had already been through

12:03.440 --> 12:08.960
the dogs in Alabama with less the Maddox in this pickaxes and bull corners with his dogs.

12:09.680 --> 12:16.800
So you already know what's right and wrong. But you've also been through the rhetoric of the Black

12:16.800 --> 12:27.440
Panthers and other violent perpetuating groups. And that wasn't the answer. So when you get into a

12:27.440 --> 12:35.360
right situation, you accomplish nothing but destruction. You need to talk. And I am duty-bound

12:36.640 --> 12:43.200
to enforce whatever orders are issued. So that's where I stood. That's why I could let that boy

12:43.200 --> 12:53.040
leave that guy back at Fort Hood. And on the second morning when we went to Grand Park,

12:53.120 --> 12:58.080
the Colonel Cork Comet came, he said, first starting, how many people you're bringing with you?

12:58.080 --> 13:02.480
I told him. He says, you're missing one, aren't you? I said, yes, he said, where is yet?

13:02.480 --> 13:06.000
I said, I left him back. He said, why? I told him. You know what he said? He said, that's fine.

13:06.720 --> 13:14.080
You did the right thing. But that was the way the unit was trained. And we were probably 40%

13:14.080 --> 13:20.000
Black. And they got more anxious to do their job when they found out the ratters were really

13:20.000 --> 13:27.120
burning down and killing their own people. They were not, they might have gotten more

13:27.120 --> 13:32.240
support if they had been out in Grand Park burning down that area of time, but they weren't.

13:32.240 --> 13:39.760
I want to go to a few photos right now that they'll sort of go along with the story that we've

13:39.760 --> 13:45.120
told one photo here, the first one if we look at it. We saw this photo last week. People didn't

13:45.120 --> 13:50.800
see the show last week. That was you after your first tour of Vietnam. And I guess just prior to

13:50.800 --> 13:56.720
this deployment to Chicago, this is about 1967 or so, I believe you told me. That would be right.

13:56.720 --> 14:04.080
Right. Okay. This is a photo from an, obviously, an aerial photo of this sort of is in line of

14:04.080 --> 14:09.360
sort of how you described what things looked like when you flew into Chicago with the, with the

14:09.360 --> 14:16.000
smoke rising from the streets. If we could, I'd like to stop the photos right now and we're going

14:16.000 --> 14:20.240
to visit a little bit about Vietnam and then we'll come back with a couple of more photos here

14:20.240 --> 14:28.320
in just a second. Before we leave the Chicago service, I wanted to read what one of the person

14:28.320 --> 14:33.840
wrote who was actually a witness to the days following the assassination said by Saturday, April

14:33.920 --> 14:39.680
6th. This has been two days after the assassination. 6,000 National Guard troops had arrived in Chicago

14:39.680 --> 14:45.280
to suppress the riots and to protect firefighters in the field. The following day, 5,000 US Army

14:45.280 --> 14:49.760
troops arrived to further curtail the rioters and by Monday, the riots had dissipated and the

14:49.760 --> 14:55.840
fires were extinguished. So you all, all together, you all pretty much stopped the riots over the weekend.

14:56.640 --> 15:02.640
In the end, only one firefighter was wounded by gunfire. 12 civilians were killed. 170 buildings

15:02.640 --> 15:08.640
were destroyed, resulting in millions of dollars of damage. So the idea to protect lives for the

15:08.640 --> 15:16.560
most part, although tragically 12 civilians were killed, y'all did your job. We tried to. Exactly.

15:16.560 --> 15:22.000
There's one thing I'd like to point out about the picture. I had been in Chicago, my father-in-law

15:22.000 --> 15:27.680
lived in Chicago, Southside Chicago. So I had been in Chicago a couple of times prior to the riots.

15:27.920 --> 15:35.600
Didn't know the city or anything, but when you are sites in or traveling as a visitor,

15:37.040 --> 15:42.800
you can only see whatever is in your field of vision. Consequently, you can't see the

15:43.920 --> 15:50.960
next street over. And when we came in with the rats, you can't see the buildings just burning on

15:51.040 --> 15:58.960
the next block. You can see those right here. Now when I go back into Chicago years later, like I

15:58.960 --> 16:04.080
was up there three or four years ago, we've been back two or three times since then. The

16:06.640 --> 16:14.000
you have a different perspective of it because now you can see the vacant spots that used to be

16:14.000 --> 16:23.440
mass solid, one block tenets housing. You can see through the vacant space to the next three

16:23.440 --> 16:29.280
streets. You know what the reason is, you know the cause. But you couldn't see that before,

16:29.280 --> 16:37.440
and you couldn't see it during, but you can see it now. The topography of the area has changed,

16:37.440 --> 16:42.320
because these lots still vacant. They haven't rebuilt. I had a boy that was

16:43.280 --> 16:52.800
walking the guard up and down his mother's house in front of his mother's house. I had one

16:52.800 --> 16:59.280
that the black stone ranger told him he could not come back to Chicago ever because they were going

17:00.800 --> 17:05.840
didn't worry about it. I didn't take the boy off the streets, put him on that 50 on the roof,

17:06.480 --> 17:13.600
but to protect him, but we did what we needed to do. Right. And he was protecting his mom's house.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.280
That's right. Bless his heart.

17:16.640 --> 17:20.080
A second tour of Vietnam, Company E, First Battalion, 12th Cav.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.880
Talk about your second tour. How it was different a little bit from the first tour. I know

17:24.880 --> 17:31.760
you talked to me about a difference in how you engaged the enemy, how the enemy engaged you

17:32.400 --> 17:39.040
learning to travel, learn from the enemy, and start traveling in small groups. Talk about the

17:39.040 --> 17:45.280
nature of your second tour of Vietnam. Well, the second tour was different primarily in approach.

17:46.240 --> 17:53.680
With the Vietnamese, it was a kind of a less live and less live. We don't really hunt down the enemy

17:53.680 --> 17:59.280
if they attack you, then you defend yourself. But we were not out there with the 10th Arab

17:59.280 --> 18:05.760
Indivision. It was not a let's go out and find him in destroy. But when you came to the care,

18:05.760 --> 18:14.480
you had to get re-orinated because now your job here now is to search and destroy. It is to find

18:14.480 --> 18:23.120
fix an annihilate or neutralize. You are in an attack mode with the American Army. Right.

18:24.080 --> 18:33.760
In Baghdad, or in Afghanistan, those guys are not just out there keeping the peace. They're looking

18:33.760 --> 18:42.880
for action. That's the nature of the beast. And with the care of you're going to get it

18:43.040 --> 18:53.760
because that's their mission. And I found it to be vastly different about what I had been trained

18:53.760 --> 19:03.840
to expect my end-time military career. And you got more than you needed. And it's like always

19:05.120 --> 19:11.200
in order to accomplish the mission, you sometimes have to go outside of the box. As a result,

19:12.000 --> 19:18.800
we devised and had certain little units that did special things. I had a hundred kill a team as

19:18.800 --> 19:23.600
an example. That was not a part of the table of organization and equipment to T-O-N-E.

19:24.800 --> 19:35.760
We just organized it. We had snipers. I had a section of snipers. That wasn't organized

19:35.840 --> 19:42.240
according to T-O-N-E. But the commanders found them to be useful because you can take a sniper

19:42.240 --> 19:49.120
and put him with every company or platoon. Special operations, special mission. By this time,

19:49.120 --> 19:56.800
though, the entire mission in Vietnam had changed. We were into a hold in pattern or a small unit

19:58.960 --> 20:05.440
type field operation. We changed commanders where Smolong was gone. And it was a small unit type

20:05.440 --> 20:15.440
operation. We also, there was another incident in that second tour that I failed to mention.

20:18.400 --> 20:30.240
One of the first units out of our battalion during the Cambodian invasion was guess who?

20:31.200 --> 20:40.000
That hundred kill a team of men in need. We had, we was taking in a 105 artillery piece,

20:40.000 --> 20:47.840
going to sit it on the ground with the crew on one helicopter, a bulldozer,

20:48.480 --> 20:54.480
slung under the second helicopter with the tracks and blade off on the third helicopter.

20:55.440 --> 21:03.120
And we go in a small force and being eight of us at this time, not counting the artillery crew

21:03.120 --> 21:09.920
and the engineer squad, the security area and right behind us. It's practically the same time

21:09.920 --> 21:18.560
landing is supposed to be an infantry company. Well, guess what? The artillery crew and the engineer

21:18.560 --> 21:29.520
crew, which was on the second craft of the engineers, they didn't land because the first

21:31.360 --> 21:38.080
that black hawk of ours landed, my crew is off. The artillery is slung beneath the belly of us.

21:38.560 --> 21:47.200
C-13, not C-13, a helicopter, transport cargo helicopter.

21:49.040 --> 21:54.240
And the ammunition is slung below that, the gun and then the ammunition.

21:54.880 --> 22:01.360
They cut the ammunition or lose. Now they should move up 50 feet, drop the gun. They don't take

22:01.360 --> 22:07.200
the crew chief, cut that gun or lose right there. It landed on top of the ammunition, flipped over.

22:07.200 --> 22:11.600
Now the artillery crew refused to get off the aircraft, of course. They can't lift it back by

22:11.600 --> 22:18.640
themselves. Engineers can't land and then because the space just for about one cargo helicopter per,

22:19.520 --> 22:27.520
short story is we wound up there on the ground, me and my people that night with orders to secure

22:27.520 --> 22:35.600
that helicopter ammunition and we're in Cambodia, which was, it depends on your outlook.

22:35.600 --> 22:42.720
Right. It's been compared to be shooting fish on a barrel. The animated warrant expecting you,

22:42.720 --> 22:50.880
they didn't know you were coming, they didn't even recognize you. So we were going down the trail,

22:51.360 --> 22:54.800
came around a little lake, looked over there and there's a guy laying up a side of a bunker just

22:54.800 --> 23:03.280
watching us. Just at home, he doesn't recognize us as the enemy. He didn't know. So if you were kind

23:04.000 --> 23:08.080
laying the mix it up, that was the place to be. We've got about five minutes left.

23:08.880 --> 23:19.360
22 November 1969 serving in Tainan Province. Talk about the action that led to you're being

23:19.360 --> 23:27.200
awarded the Silver Star. Once again, we was out with that Honakilla team and in this time we got

23:27.200 --> 23:32.880
a captain from the S2 out with, we received information that the boundary between the first

23:32.880 --> 23:41.520
care division and the 25th infantry division will be in utilized as a transportation communications

23:41.520 --> 23:50.560
alley for the NVA. And this was established because neither unit could shoot to within 200 meters

23:50.560 --> 23:55.680
of this boundary line without getting permission from the other. So if the enemy sits out there one night

23:55.680 --> 23:59.600
and watches, he knows that you're shooting up the here from that direction, up the here from that

23:59.600 --> 24:06.400
direction but you're not shooting here. So he just safely walks down the trail. So we took that

24:06.400 --> 24:14.720
crew out there to ambush this thing and we did it. We killed two people and attempted an

24:14.720 --> 24:20.800
extraction by the battalion commander with his aircraft and that went nowhere except with 13 bullet

24:20.800 --> 24:25.600
holes in it. And then we must run and forth for the next four hours and we've got three other

24:25.600 --> 24:30.640
aircraft shot up. I don't know how many people wound it. Sure story was they could not extract us

24:32.240 --> 24:41.040
and we lost one KIE and that and two people wound it and wound up with only three or four people

24:41.040 --> 24:48.720
and being extracted eventually one of those outside the box deals we talked about about a captain

24:48.720 --> 24:56.000
from the 25th Infantry Division. He had an armored outfit and he had told me early in the day

24:56.000 --> 25:02.960
when he inserted us while only resupply running to our location. If I got in trouble calling my

25:02.960 --> 25:10.240
dear and he responded. He got us out of there. So I have a strong affection for that man today.

25:10.240 --> 25:15.440
I hope that you did. I want to read the citation where you were awarded the Silver Star.

25:16.400 --> 25:24.080
It says 22 November 1969 while serving in the Tainin Province Republic of Vietnam went

25:24.080 --> 25:29.600
a force led by First Sergeant Bailey left their position. They encountered intense automatic

25:29.600 --> 25:34.800
weapons fire. First Sergeant Bailey repeatedly exposed himself to the hostile fire to pull

25:34.800 --> 25:40.000
the wounded to safety. His galleon action is in keeping with the highest traditions of the

25:40.000 --> 25:45.360
military service and reflects great credit upon himself as unit and the United States Army.

25:45.920 --> 25:52.560
The Silver Star obviously it's an award that you own proudly. Yes that would be true.

25:56.560 --> 26:06.240
I don't need any more. Right. I wanted your awards and accommodations for many among them

26:07.840 --> 26:14.320

we're out of time but thank you for your service and thank you for being here. Thank you for having me.

27:16.240 --> 27:22.400
All right thank you. Jeffrey Bailey retired from the Army 31 January 1973 the same year that he

27:22.400 --> 27:28.560
started Bailey trucking which he and his family still operate today. He and Orrah have been married

27:28.560 --> 27:34.000
some 53 years and have four children and five grandchildren. We salute Jeffrey Bailey for his two

27:34.000 --> 27:45.760
decades of brave military service. I'm Tom Turbivill join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
