WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
you

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please rise to honor America with the US Navy color guard and the US Navy sea chanters?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Okay, keep my open.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Advance the colors.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
The US Navy is the only one who has a long history.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
The US Navy is the only one who has a long history.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
The US Navy is the only one who has a long history.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Ready? Go!

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light?

01:49.000 --> 01:56.000
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
Whose first stripes and bright stars to the perilous fight?

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
For the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,

02:18.000 --> 02:25.000
It flew through the night, and our flag was still there.

02:25.000 --> 02:35.000
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave?

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
For the land of the free,

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
And the home of the brave.

03:35.000 --> 03:50.000
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.

03:50.000 --> 04:05.000
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
All right, now let's go with the rocket started.

05:27.000 --> 05:34.000
This is the 3-7 fuel miss-gold.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
One flight to the sea.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
At 14 CSI, off to the end of the road.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
Okay, you're right, now we're the surface, and it's come all the way.

07:15.000 --> 07:22.000
We're here.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
The rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
The bombs bursting in air,

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
The bombs bursting in air,

08:41.000 --> 08:49.000
The bombs bursting in air,

08:49.000 --> 09:04.000
Before we have a prayer, I'd like to share with you two special experiences that we had with Alan.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Many knew him as a famous astronaut.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
Most of you here as a friend, a colleague.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
We knew him more as a family man, as a devoted husband of Louise,

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
And the father of Laura, Julie and Alice.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Our two daughters are the same age as his youngest two.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
They have always been the best of friends.

09:30.000 --> 09:38.000
Many times we saw Alan carrying the girls dolls and t-shirts from their house to ours,

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
And from ours to theirs.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Our girls regarded Alan more as their friends daddy,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
And not as a world famous figure.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
So when he offered to fly them along with his three to Maine to summer camp,

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
We were thrilled for their sakes.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
We thought, just think what the children can tell their children,

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
That Alan Shepard had flown them to Maine.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
As parents, that was our perspective.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
Having been a World War II B-17 pilot, I immediately asked him,

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
How are you going to manage five rambunctious little girls on the plane?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
He replied, it's very simple.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
If they get restless, I'll just go up to 10,000 feet.

10:33.000 --> 10:43.000
And they will all go to sleep.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
We were at the local airport when they took off.

10:47.000 --> 10:53.000
They did have some engine trouble, so they flew directly to Hobby to get it repaired.

10:53.000 --> 11:00.000
Eventually, they took off for Maine, and route they made other stops to Rethuel.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
Hours later, they arrived at Vaughnstable Airport in Massachusetts.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
Upon arrival, one of our little girls called me on the telephone, and implored,

11:13.000 --> 11:20.000
Oh, daddy, please, please next time, can we go commercial?

11:20.000 --> 11:32.000
Now on to a more serious remembrance.

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
After his return from the moon, my wife, gingerly asked him,

11:38.000 --> 11:44.000
Alan, did you ever consider that you might not get back from the moon?

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
He replied very solemnly, oh yes, we thought about that.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
My friends, this is genuine courage and bravery.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
This is a tribute to the courage, bravery, and heroism of Alan Shepherd,

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
and it is a tribute to all of the astronauts.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
These are brave men.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
I am sure I speak for all Americans.

12:13.000 --> 12:23.000
We are proud of you, and we admire and appreciate your courage and bravery in the space effort.

12:23.000 --> 12:31.000
I could give no more sacred prayer than the following verses from the Bible, songs.

12:31.000 --> 12:39.000
Whether shall I go from thy spirit, or whether shall I flee from thy presence,

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
if I ascend up into heaven, thou art there.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
If I make my bed and hell, behold, thou art there.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,

12:56.000 --> 13:05.000
even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.

13:05.000 --> 13:12.000
As a young boy, who was a Sunday school student, Alan Shepherd learned a prayer.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
His wife, Louise, wants his friends to hear this prayer as he came to know it.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
She stated that this prayer had a profound influence on his life.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
This is the prayer by Mary Baker Eddie.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Thy kingdom come.

13:34.000 --> 13:45.000
Let the reign of divine truth, life and love be established in me, and rule out of me all sin,

13:45.000 --> 13:56.000
and may thy word enrich the affections of all mankind and govern them, and from the scriptures.

13:57.000 --> 14:06.000
Simon Peter answered him, Lord, we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ,

14:06.000 --> 14:17.000
the Son of the living God, and this is the promise that he has promised us, even eternal life.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Good afternoon.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
Louise, the Shepherd family, ladies and gentlemen.

14:34.000 --> 14:42.000
It's wonderful to look at in that audience and almost recognize every face there.

14:42.000 --> 14:49.000
We are here this afternoon to remember Alan Shepherd as a friend and as a colleague,

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
one who we all admire and will find impossible to replace.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
In 1959, when the United States decided to fly man in space,

15:02.000 --> 15:09.000
the newly chartered NASA needed a number of men to fly their Mercury spacecraft.

15:09.000 --> 15:18.000
The requirements for these aviators and soon to be called astronauts were reasonably straightforward and unambiguous.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
A number of us in the space task group had come from the world of airplane flight tests,

15:24.000 --> 15:32.000
and we recognized that we needed experienced test pilots who understood the rigors of testing the unknown

15:32.000 --> 15:38.000
and were accustomed to putting their lives in jeopardy every time they flew.

15:38.000 --> 15:46.000
They had to be prepared to do their job regardless of the threatening circumstances they might find themselves in.

15:47.000 --> 15:53.000
We also wanted them to understand the engineering design required of this new flying machine

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
and to be able to participate in his development.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
Alan Shepherd volunteered to be one of the men we were looking for.

16:03.000 --> 16:13.000
He came to this new challenge because in his mind, space flight was the next step in man's quest to fly higher and faster.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
We test pilot, this was his kind of business.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
He did not come into the space program looking for glory.

16:21.000 --> 16:29.000
Indeed, many of his peers looked with scorn on what they thought was a step backward in test flying

16:29.000 --> 16:38.000
and refused to consider themselves as test specimens for a highly experimental program with a questionable future.

16:39.000 --> 16:47.000
In fact, if you listen to the so-called medical community who were advising NASA in 1959,

16:47.000 --> 16:54.000
the test pilots who were criticizing Project Mercury were justified in their evaluation.

16:54.000 --> 17:03.000
The great majority of the doctors believed that man's reaction to this new environment of zero gravity and a perfect vacuum

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
would cause disorientation, nausea, loss of sight, and other dire ailments.

17:10.000 --> 17:19.000
And as a result, it might be totally incapable of doing work, much less conducting the complex and intricate task

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
we were expecting them to carry out.

17:22.000 --> 17:32.000
Fortunately, Bob Gilruth and those of us who worked for him believed that a qualified test pilot with proper training

17:32.000 --> 17:40.000
could most likely accomplish the same task in space that they had been conducting in high performance airplanes.

17:40.000 --> 17:49.000
We wanted the men who were going to fly to be an integral part of the spacecraft just as they had been in the airplanes they flew.

17:49.000 --> 17:59.000
As the first man flight approached, the competition for being first among the seven astronauts became very intense.

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
As in any group greater than one, it was difficult to choose who should be selected.

18:05.000 --> 18:14.000
Bob Gilruth, a man who never received the proper credit for being the father of man's space flight, met with the astronauts

18:14.000 --> 18:25.000
and asked them to write a brief essay on who and why they should be chosen to fly the first flight, excluding themselves.

18:30.000 --> 18:43.000
From this interesting and provocative exercise, and with the advice and consent of his staff, he picked Alan Shepherd to fly the first man Mercury Redstone flight.

18:43.000 --> 18:52.000
These were heady times, and now, and already charged, doubled his efforts to train for the 15-minute sub-orbital flight.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
Unfortunately, Shepherd's flight had to be preceded by the flight of a chimpanzee.

18:59.000 --> 19:11.000
Although we successfully launched and recovered him, the hot engine of the Redstone caused an early shutdown, which precipitated an escape rocket separation,

19:12.000 --> 19:21.000
suggesting him to 17G and giving gave the false impression that the animal had failed to perform.

19:21.000 --> 19:32.000
The demand of further Redstone testing and a requirement to test a large number of animals on the John's L.S. Infuge postponed Shepherd's flight.

19:32.000 --> 19:40.000
Shepherd was extremely disappointed and agitated by the delay, as was the entire space task group.

19:40.000 --> 19:50.000
The real disappointment came several weeks later when the Russians launched Yuri Gagarin into orbit and recovered him after one revolution.

19:50.000 --> 20:05.000
With added resolve and the permission of the President's Scientific Advisory Committee, the animal tests were canceled, a test flight of the Redstone was completed, and MR-3 was given a green light.

20:05.000 --> 20:15.000
After several launch attempts had been scrubbed because of weather, on Friday, May 5, 1961, Shepherd was again ready to fly.

20:15.000 --> 20:26.000
NASA had decided to allow the media, including television, to cover the launch in real time, putting tremendous pressure on everyone involved.

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
But this decision turned out to be far wiser than all of us could have imagined.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
The launch was scheduled for 7am, but clouds and rain covered the cape.

20:38.000 --> 20:45.000
We decided to press on, have Alan enter the capsule and wait for the weather to clear.

20:45.000 --> 20:52.000
The picture I had on my console of Shepherd, which you just saw, exiting the trailer at the pad,

20:52.000 --> 20:59.000
was search light shining on him and his silver spacesuit is still emblazoned in my mind.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
It was one of the most exciting moments of our lives.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
We all waited, and finally the weather began to clear and we picked up the count.

21:09.000 --> 21:21.000
As we reached two minus two minus two minutes, the magic point in account in those days, Stan White began giving me Alan's vital signs.

21:21.000 --> 21:28.000
And he reported his heart rate was increasing and near lift off reached 180.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
He was not the only one whose adrenaline was flowing.

21:32.000 --> 21:39.000
I looked down to make some notes and suddenly noticed the microphone on my headset was missing.

21:39.000 --> 21:50.000
I was about to have it replaced when I realized it was still there, but I was shaking so hard that it appeared as a blur in my eyes.

21:51.000 --> 22:02.000
We all remembered Shepherd's exclamations during launch, his staccato reporting, and his marvelous description of the earth and the heavens he viewed from his lofty position.

22:02.000 --> 22:11.000
He performed exactly as you would expect the finest test pilot to do, in his entry and recovery were equally spectacular.

22:11.000 --> 22:18.000
The Navy helicopter retrieved Shepherd and his spacecraft, and history was made.

22:18.000 --> 22:27.000
The reaction of the country to this brief sub-overdalflight was incredible, and Shepherd had become the hero he had not set out to be.

22:27.000 --> 22:36.000
The world praised the U.S. for its success, but particularly for the willingness to share it with the rest of the world as it happened.

22:36.000 --> 22:45.000
This day reported was in stark contrast to the Russian secrecy and failure to report their missions until they were successfully completed.

22:45.000 --> 22:57.000
The country celebrated the astronauts' accomplishment, and President Kennedy invited Shepherd and his colleagues to the White House to receive the country's highest honor.

22:57.000 --> 23:14.000
The impression that Shepherd's flight made on the country and the world was not overlooked by the President, and within weeks he had decided to challenge the nation with landing men on the moon and returning them safely to Earth before this decade is out.

23:14.000 --> 23:25.000
Alan Shepherd had not only become the nation's first astronaut, he had inspired his country to set out on one of its greatest adventures.

23:25.000 --> 23:38.000
Alan's contribution to his country is commitment to the space program and his willingness to always go the last mile to show it, what made him so dear to all of us.

23:38.000 --> 23:44.000
I'd like to end with this prayer from the Episcopal Book of Current Prayer.

23:44.000 --> 23:56.000
Almighty God, we remember this day before the thy faithful servant, Alan Shepherd, and we pray thee that having opened to him the gates of larger life,

23:56.000 --> 24:08.000
that will receive him more and more into thy joyful service, that he may win with thee and thy servants everywhere, the eternal victory through Jesus Christ, Alan.

24:08.000 --> 24:28.000
Please, family, guests, friends of ours, all of us here today.

24:28.000 --> 24:44.000
Alan Shepherd was many things. He was a patriot, he was a leader, he was a competitor, a fierce competitor, he was a hero, most importantly to us, he was a close friend.

24:44.000 --> 24:57.000
When we seven were chosen as the first American astronauts, Al stood out, and I had first known Al several years earlier when we were both test pilots at the Naval Air Test Center at Patuxen River, Maryland.

24:57.000 --> 25:07.000
But it wasn't until the Mercury program, I saw firsthand the determination, the toughness, the courage of Alan Shepherd.

25:07.000 --> 25:14.000
I think we have to remember as Chris referred to a moment ago, was the depths of the Cold War, we tend to forget that sometimes.

25:14.000 --> 25:22.000
And all of a sudden, after Sputnik America's technological superiority in this world was under serious question.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
We try to put up satellites, we fail.

25:27.000 --> 25:41.000
We had been beaten in the early days of the space race by a country that bragged that American, American now sleeps under a Soviet moon as they Twittered us.

25:41.000 --> 25:54.000
It meant something to us. Many kids of the world were going to Moscow for education instead of through our schools in this country, and nations were being affected by the propaganda that was being put out.

25:55.000 --> 26:07.000
We'd sum it up by saying it was a very, very low time for American self-esteem. The naysayers and the doubters about our naysam were getting very, very serious attention.

26:07.000 --> 26:23.000
But Al brought us back. He brought us back because of his leadership in the Mercury program. He brought us back because he carried the American questing spirit on his shoulders into the heavens.

26:23.000 --> 26:33.000
He brought us back because Al took that challenge from the Soviets, not only as the Patriot he was, Al took that personally.

26:33.000 --> 26:41.000
All seven of us watched some of those early rocket tests, and we watched some unfail and occasionally in very spectacular fashion.

26:41.000 --> 26:51.000
We could spend a couple hours here this afternoon talking about our experiences and watching some of the things down there, and then people saying, you're going to whoop one of those things.

26:52.000 --> 27:11.000
But that didn't deter us, and especially it did not deter Al. Named spacecraft Freedom 7. We were free to name our own spacecraft back in those days. Freedom 7. His view of where this whole program stood in relationship to openness around the world, what we stood for.

27:11.000 --> 27:28.000
In fact, as he sat in Freedom 7 through yet another delay before his historic Mercury mission, he was very anxious to get going, and we heard an anxious to get going Al suggests, why don't you fix your little problem and light this candle.

27:28.000 --> 27:38.000
And he wasn't making light, but he, that one moment eloquently portrays Al as a Al's dedication to getting the program going.

27:38.000 --> 27:46.000
America has lost one of his true adventures. Someone whose entire life was dictated by the American questing spirit.

27:46.000 --> 27:55.000
And Alan and Scott and Gordo and Wally and I have lost more than a friend. We've lost another brother.

27:56.000 --> 28:08.000
The National Aviation Hall of Fame every year has an induction ceremony that traditionally closes with the reading of what is without a doubt the single best known poem among aviators all over the world.

28:09.000 --> 28:18.000
He was written by an American who joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and was killed at the age of 19 flying a Spitfire during the Battle of Britain.

28:19.000 --> 28:31.000
The words have an even more special meaning to us today than they did in 1977 when the name of Alan Shepherd was inscribed in the Aviation Hall of Fame.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
The poem is titled High Flight.

28:36.000 --> 28:44.000
Well, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth and danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings.

28:44.000 --> 28:55.000
Sunward I've climbed and joined the tumbling worth of sun-split clouds and done a hundred things you have not dreamed of, wheeled and soared and swung high in the sunlit silence.

28:56.000 --> 29:13.000
Overing there I've chased the shouting wind along and flung my eager craft through footless halls of air. Up, up the long delirious burning blue I've topped the windswept heights with easy grace where never-lark or even eagle flew.

29:14.000 --> 29:29.000
And while with silent lifting mind I've trod the high untressed past sanctity of space, put out my hand and touch the face of God.

29:30.000 --> 29:41.000
Even as we meet here today, Alan is now right now, this very minute, experiencing that ultimate of all times, high flight.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
But here we will all miss him very much.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
So the weasen the family are thoughts and our prayers with you.

30:00.000 --> 30:11.000
It has been nearly four decades since I first met Al Shepard.

30:11.000 --> 30:28.000
Shortly after that I first came to know him early in our training when I rode in his corvette from Langley Field to John'sville for some early centrifuge training.

30:29.000 --> 30:53.000
By the time we got to John'sville I realized I was in the company of a dedicated naval officer, a unique and capable aviator, a born leader and a serious competitor in anything he decided he wanted to do.

30:53.000 --> 31:22.000
The placard in his corvette on the dashboard saying, specially made for Alan B. Shepard only added to my awe and respect for this multi-talented fellow I never asked and that is why I never found out how he came by that special compensation from general motors.

31:23.000 --> 31:29.000
But I always wondered.

31:30.000 --> 31:49.000
For a long time both Al and I lived with some names that we were not particularly fond of.

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
His was Bartlett mine is Malcolm.

31:54.000 --> 32:03.000
We fell into the custom after a while of always addressing each other by those names.

32:03.000 --> 32:11.000
In keeping with that custom I will now say my hats off to you Bartlett.

32:11.000 --> 32:20.000
Thank you for all you have done for the Navy, for the space program and for your country.

32:20.000 --> 32:29.000
It is an honor and a privilege to have known you.

32:30.000 --> 32:52.000
Weezer family friends and some military people I might add I would like to recommend that we all think of as rear Alan Bartlett, Shepard, Jr.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
U.S. Navy Yankee from New Hampshire.

32:59.000 --> 33:14.000
Naval Academy graduate, Black Shoe, Cogswell in the Pacific, Brown Shoe, Naval Aviator, aircraft carriers, test pilot, astronaut and a very generous man.

33:15.000 --> 33:22.000
When we were brought, I don't think we were really ordered, I think we volunteered to Langley Air Force base.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
We suddenly realized we didn't have any more uniforms. They were gone.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
We were going to be civilians for an in-on.

33:28.000 --> 33:33.000
Our budget was rather tough because I don't recall I was talking to Joe and my wife just the other day.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
I don't recall ever going to work without wearing a uniform.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
This is a big transition for us.

33:39.000 --> 33:50.000
We sat in this very humble office, seven of us with Nancy Lo sitting outside guarding the door as our secretary, warning what the heck we're doing here.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
The seven of us bonded almost immediately.

33:52.000 --> 34:05.000
We left on different parts of the continent literally to check on engineering drawings and engineering plans, on engineering symposiums, medical tests in addition to the original ones we had, briefings, simulations.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
We were kind of busy.

34:07.000 --> 34:13.000
And each Friday we came back and debriefed each other so we knew what was going on.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
The only way we could cover the whole ballpark.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
With that, we began to realize that each of us were participating in whatever flight we had.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
As I watched I saw Alan Shepard stand out.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
I made the mistake of voting for him on that period of the thing that I think about it.

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
As a result I could see Alan was becoming a leader.

34:36.000 --> 34:45.000
We had our Mercury program go on and time came on and Deak Slighten was to fly who was remembered here not too long ago.

34:45.000 --> 34:52.000
Now, they're tough to come back again here, but thinking of Deak, we realized that if he was going to be grounded, we better have him in charge.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
We didn't want, excuse me, an admiral coming down to take care of us and be responsible for us.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
We wanted one of our own.

35:00.000 --> 35:06.000
After Mercury, Alan was due to fly Germany and was grounded because of Minus Syndrome and near problem.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Growning for almost a decade.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
Deak asked, Al, would you help me out and be in charge of the astronaut office?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
We had two great leaders.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
We've lost two of our great leaders.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
We're down to four now.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Lost Gus on the launch pad.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
But the brotherhood we had will endure forever.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
It's that interesting part of Alan Sherpard that came to light when he got to the moon finally.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
And he hit that ball for miles and miles.

35:32.000 --> 35:41.000
My last recollection of Alan hitting a golf ball was on Kauai on the sixth screen of Ocean 9 on the edge.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
He drove a ball off the edge into the Pacific Ocean.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
He said, that one went miles and miles.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
I didn't have to take a mulligan.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
We'll remember Alan B.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I was called Skyray by him.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
The family, of course, we all think of it.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
It's kind of tough to be called Bartlett, isn't it Bartlett?

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
At least we had a dark in the high flight.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
And that's the two children of Grancho and the valon, of course.

36:08.000 --> 36:14.000
The whole family here, I love and feel so very warm.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
I'll make it. Playboy out.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
Who is his family?

36:35.000 --> 36:41.000
I sort of had a message for Alan in day.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
We had a lot of adventures together, Alan.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
We were in the first group of six contestants, start out in Washington.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
For a whole week of mental exams.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Written exams.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
And then we went on to a lot of lace clinic.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
That was very interesting.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
Because they'd been told that we had as many people as they could out.

37:05.000 --> 37:10.000
So we were the first of the skinny pigs, if you will, to come through.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
And it was very interesting.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
They weeded a lot of people out.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
They were brutal.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
But it was real adventure.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
Then we went from there to right patterns and air force base,

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
where we went through the physiological training, where they put us on vibrators,

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
and they dunked us in ice water, and they roasted us in ovens,

37:27.000 --> 37:32.000
and they sealed us up in soundproof chambers.

37:32.000 --> 37:37.000
And everything they could think of to do to the people with really discurred gym

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
and see if they could tolerate it.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
And out of that, then we had a real adventure in April of 59,

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
when we were all brought out on the stage like this,

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
and announced the world who this seven, first seven were.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
And boy, there were lots of cameras, lots of reporters.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
That was certainly most of us as a really exposure to the news media

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
and the cameras of the world of public relations.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
But we survived that, didn't we, Al?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
We got through it.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
And we survived the Navy program at school, went through UDT training,

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
like we went through the other kind of training we'd think of.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
We survived that one, and we roasted them to the bottom of the desert together.

38:28.000 --> 38:34.000
Found out we could learn to get along all right in a desert situation.

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
We survived the jungle as a Panama.

38:39.000 --> 38:45.000
And we survived the research, and really the research and the running

38:45.000 --> 38:51.000
and the engineering that went on the Johnville centrifuge.

38:51.000 --> 38:57.000
It was brutal, but it proved how strong, how capable the human body really is.

38:57.000 --> 39:04.000
We raised many miles in identical car vets.

39:04.000 --> 39:11.000
And I'm sorry, Al, that I never told you that I changed the ratio

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
and my differential.

39:15.000 --> 39:25.000
And you really weren't any less a driver,

39:25.000 --> 39:31.000
just that I cheated a little on you.

39:31.000 --> 39:37.000
We spent long days and nights getting ready to get MR3 ready to go.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
I was going to be the blockhouse communicator.

39:41.000 --> 39:47.000
And we were together on the communication system in the launch.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
And I'll never forget there was not a dry eye anywhere in the block house,

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
and I only launched.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
And I had to run around Brown and Kertley just right at my right elbow.

39:58.000 --> 40:03.000
And they were very excited to be able to speak to Al very briefly.

40:03.000 --> 40:11.000
And then you were my capsule communicator on my MR3 fly.

40:11.000 --> 40:21.000
Well, we had lots of good flying, lots of good times together, lots of good tests,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
and a lot of things going on.

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
Now you're up there in that big hangar in the sky, and a lot of good flights.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
And it will miss you out.

40:31.000 --> 40:36.000
We will be there for long, so we'll try some of that flying ourselves.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
My best all of you, and we'll miss you out.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
Thank you.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
Good afternoon.

40:54.000 --> 41:05.000
It's my privilege, but sad duty to represent the Apollo 14 crew on this occasion.

41:05.000 --> 41:19.000
I know Stu would have wanted to be here, but his wonderful family has come over to be with us for this occasion.

41:19.000 --> 41:31.000
And in thinking of Stu and Alan, I'm reminded of an event that happened as we came up from the lunar surface.

41:31.000 --> 41:37.000
If you remember the tapes, as we came into sight of the command module,

41:37.000 --> 41:43.000
you could hear Stuart's voice come over the radio and say,

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
Hello down there, fearless one.

41:46.000 --> 41:53.000
What are you doing down there? You seem to have lost a little weight since the last time I saw you.

41:53.000 --> 42:07.000
I'm somewhat sure that last week Stuart might have repeated almost those same words.

42:07.000 --> 42:22.000
I am privileged that Alan shows Stuart and I had a good time with him.

42:22.000 --> 42:34.000
He was a wonderful teammate, colleague, leader, boss.

42:34.000 --> 42:43.000
I remember on the final day of our simulation of the lunar landing before the flight,

42:43.000 --> 42:51.000
when the team had thrown virtually every malfunction they could find at us.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
And we successfully got down and it was over.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
I turned to him and said, congratulations, boss.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
I think we're ready to go.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
And he smiled in that innumerable way.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
Yeah, I think we are.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
I want to pay tribute to him.

43:16.000 --> 43:23.000
What a privilege it was to serve with Alan Shepherd.

43:23.000 --> 43:44.000
And I'm sure that wherever it is that astronauts and explorers go when we depart this realm.

43:44.000 --> 44:02.000
With Alan and Sue, deep concussed Roger Ed, Elliott Charlie, CC, Jack, Jim, and Ron,

44:02.000 --> 44:13.000
pioneering and exploring and doing things that one day we will all be doing together.

44:13.000 --> 44:18.000
Again.

44:18.000 --> 44:31.000
Very well and thanks a lot.

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
Louise, Shepherd family, distinguished ladies and gentlemen.

44:37.000 --> 44:45.000
I first met Alan Shepherd when he and I were part of the original Mercury Canada group.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
Of course, I knew of him through his work he had done at the Naval Air Test Center.

44:49.000 --> 44:58.000
Alan offered me a ride in his Corvette from the hotel to the Dolly Madison House where we were briefed by Project Mercury.

44:58.000 --> 45:04.000
And I thought to myself, this is one naval officer who really has it made.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
How much does one of these cost, I asked him?

45:08.000 --> 45:15.000
Any reply if you got to ask, you can't afford to own one.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
But Alan was a natural born leader.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
The type that people want to emulate and follow.

45:22.000 --> 45:29.000
And sure enough, it wasn't long before a lot of us were driving Corvettes.

45:30.000 --> 45:35.000
And Charles Legacy as a pioneer in our space program is firmly etched in the history books.

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
He was fiercely competitive and won the position to be the first American in space.

45:40.000 --> 45:54.000
He had the motivation and the perseverance to hang in there during eight years of being grounded before he finally flew on Apollo 14 and landed on the moon in a place called Fraumaro.

45:55.000 --> 46:04.000
When that opportunity was earlier denied me, I cannot think of a more appropriate person to take my place than Alan B. Shepard.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
Alan's legacy in space is a thing of the past.

46:07.000 --> 46:16.000
A legacy future generations can reflect on when they want to reminisce about the early heroes of space exploration.

46:16.000 --> 46:23.000
But Alan Shepard left another legacy, one that did not die with him.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
A legacy that is alive, growing and prosperous.

46:27.000 --> 46:36.000
He was the driving force behind the establishment by the Mercury Seven astronauts of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation.

46:36.000 --> 46:44.000
It started out modestly enough in 1986 with a distribution of $1,000 to seven aspiring future engineers and scientists.

46:44.000 --> 46:52.000
But just recently the foundation distributed $8,500 to over 17 students.

46:52.000 --> 46:58.000
Today I would like to introduce to you a young lady, Ms. Lisa Beeson.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
She is an early participant of the scholarship program.

47:02.000 --> 47:13.000
Having received three scholarships is now a member of the board of directors of the foundation and who is forever grateful to its chairman, Alan Shepard.

47:23.000 --> 47:29.000
Admiral Alan B. Shepard, Jr. Some of you knew him simply as Alan Shepard.

47:29.000 --> 47:36.000
When I was putting together my thoughts for today, I was somewhat uncertain how I wanted to refer to Alan Shepard.

47:36.000 --> 47:47.000
Because he was simultaneously one of the greatest heroes in American history and also one of the most approachable and friendly people I have known.

47:48.000 --> 48:01.000
I am here to pay tribute to Alan Shepard today because of the tremendous impact that he had on my life and on the lives of the other 105 people who have so far received the Astronaut Scholarship.

48:01.000 --> 48:16.000
Everyone knows about Alan's incredible accomplishments as the first American to fly in space, his walk on the moon, and the other public achievements throughout his career in the space program and in the Navy.

48:17.000 --> 48:26.000
However, since 1984, Alan worked on something which was not as widely known, but which I think will prove to be his greatest legacy.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
That is the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation.

48:30.000 --> 48:42.000
Even among people who have achieved great goals, Alan stands out because he continued to contribute to the greatness of America up through the last days of his life.

48:43.000 --> 48:51.000
It was his dedication to the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation which made it into the solid organization that it is today.

48:51.000 --> 48:58.000
He helped it grow from its beginnings of awarding just $7,000 in 1986.

48:58.000 --> 49:11.000
To today, we award over $144,000 annually in the form of 17 scholarships that go to some of the top science and engineering students in the nation.

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
He never rested on his past accomplishments.

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
I was always impressed with the amount of time effort and caring that he put into the Scholarship Foundation.

49:21.000 --> 49:32.000
He viewed it as his way, along with the other astronauts, of continuing to strengthen America's position and capabilities in science and engineering.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
And it worked.

49:35.000 --> 49:53.000
The Scholarship winners receive not only a monetary award, all of the current recipients and the alumni receive an annual invitation to meet astronauts from the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab and Space Shuttle programs, and to meet each other.

49:53.000 --> 49:59.000
It is through these annual meetings that a strong network of scientists and engineers is being formed.

50:00.000 --> 50:08.000
Individually and together, they are making advances on many of today's frontiers in science and technology.

50:08.000 --> 50:15.000
It is also at these annual meetings where so many of the Astronaut Scholars have been inspired by Alan Shepherd.

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
It was obvious how much he cared about the Scholarship winners when he met with them.

50:20.000 --> 50:28.000
We were all so thrilled to talk to him, and I loved the way he took a genuine interest in the lives of the students and alumni.

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
This group of young scientists and engineers is lucky to have met him.

50:33.000 --> 50:40.000
I would not have achieved the success I've experienced today without Alan's dedication to this Scholarship program.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
The Scholarship was the most significant source of funding for my college education.

50:45.000 --> 50:53.000
And then after graduation, when I started volunteering with the Foundation, it was the support and encouragement of Alan and the other astronauts,

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
which gave me the confidence needed to advance quickly in my career and engineering at Westinghouse.

50:59.000 --> 51:06.000
Without that positive feedback, I honestly believe I would not be in the position I am today.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
It's difficult to describe the impact that he made.

51:10.000 --> 51:18.000
Then during the last eight years, as I came to know Alan, and serving with him on the Board of Directors of the Scholarship Foundation for the past couple of years,

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
he always made me feel like I could do anything beyond my wildest dreams.

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
All of the astronauts' scholars will be forever grateful to Alan Shepard for everything that he did for us.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
These simple words can't express the difference he made.

51:33.000 --> 51:40.000
To Louise and the entire Shepard family, I think you have a wonderful guardian angel watching over you now.

51:41.000 --> 51:49.000
And I think I've now discovered the answer to the uncertainty that I posed before about what's the best way to refer to Alan Shepard.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
I think I'll just call him my friend.

51:52.000 --> 52:13.000
Louise, Shepard family, and all the friends of Alan Shepard here today.

52:13.000 --> 52:21.000
Before I make my personal remarks, I'd like to read you a letter from the President.

52:21.000 --> 52:30.000
Dear Mrs. Shepard, Florey and I would deeply sadden to learn of your husband's death and our hearts go out to you.

52:30.000 --> 52:38.000
Alan Shepard was a true hero, courage, determination, an irrepressible sense of humor.

52:38.000 --> 52:45.000
He blazed the trail for our nation into the unknown and sparked the dreams of a generation.

52:46.000 --> 52:59.000
As the first American in space in one of only 12 to walk on the moon, he made an enormous contributions to our space program and expanded the reach of human knowledge.

52:59.000 --> 53:10.000
I hope you will take comfort in knowing that your husband holds a special place not only in our nation's history, but also in the hearts of his fellow Americans.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
His death is a great loss for us all.

53:13.000 --> 53:19.000
We are keeping you and your family in our thoughts and prayers, sincerely, Bill Clinton.

53:19.000 --> 53:43.000
I know it can be done, that it's important for it to be done, and I want to do it.

53:43.000 --> 53:49.000
These simple but poignant words were written in Life Magazine in 1959.

53:49.000 --> 54:01.000
The author captured NASA's mind, body, and soul. The author was NASA's mind, body, and soul, Alan Shepard.

54:02.000 --> 54:15.000
Alan did to dream. He believed in his heart that the NASA family had the talent, courage, and focus to do what others said we in America couldn't do.

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
And he wanted to be first.

54:19.000 --> 54:25.000
He liked the other astronauts of Mercury 7 wanted to lead the way.

54:26.000 --> 54:38.000
But not just in the early days, everyone knows about Alan Shepard's historic ride on Freedom 7 and his golf shot during Apollo 14.

54:38.000 --> 54:51.000
But he did so much more. He was a fighter who always fought for our nation and its space program. He always fought for the future.

54:51.000 --> 55:01.000
I remember one instance in 1993 when the space program was in big trouble in the Congress.

55:01.000 --> 55:13.000
Alan always the competitor went to work. He wrote editorials and made phone calls on the upcoming vote on the nation's space program.

55:13.000 --> 55:20.000
John Glenn can tell you that members of Congress get a lot of phone calls from a lot of important people.

55:20.000 --> 55:28.000
But when Alan Shepard was on the line, you always picked up the phone.

55:28.000 --> 55:37.000
Many people predicted a resounding loss and many people predicted and then the space exploration for decades to come.

55:38.000 --> 55:51.000
America won its space program by a single vote that year. Ever since the margin of victory has increased and ever since the space program has gotten stronger.

55:51.000 --> 56:03.000
We win in large part because Alan Shepard knew it could be done that it was important that it be done and he wanted to do it.

56:03.000 --> 56:15.000
Alan was not only a fighter but a visionary. Alan told me on many occasions about his vision for Ma's exploration. His eyes would light up.

56:15.000 --> 56:23.000
No surprise. He personally wanted to go and he wanted to be first.

56:24.000 --> 56:29.000
To tell you today Alan, America will go to Ma's.

56:29.000 --> 56:42.000
When we do it, it will be because we like you knew it could be done that it was important that it be done and that we wanted to do it.

56:42.000 --> 56:51.000
That's the way Alan thought he knew no other way and now NASA thinks the same way.

56:51.000 --> 57:03.000
Alan Shepard was unmind. Before the Mercury 7, when named, not too many people really knew about our space program in America or the world.

57:03.000 --> 57:10.000
NASA was around but we're really a bunch of nerdy engineers and scientists.

57:11.000 --> 57:17.000
Talented and hardworking nerds nonetheless.

57:17.000 --> 57:31.000
But then Alan Shepard and the Mercury 7 came along. Their intense determined and willing to risk their lives to open the space frontier for our country.

57:32.000 --> 57:43.000
They gave America's space program a real face and they gave our nation what all nations and what all people need, heroes.

57:43.000 --> 57:52.000
Genuine, bona fide, heroes. The Mercury 7 was the beginning and Alan was the first.

57:53.000 --> 58:05.000
At a time when our nation's confidence was down, he had the courage to climb on top that not completely tested redstone missile and opened the space frontier.

58:05.000 --> 58:10.000
He was our mind and our body.

58:11.000 --> 58:25.000
That first trip to space lasted only 15 minutes but the space Alan Shepard occupies in our history and our nation's consciousness and our hearts will last forever.

58:25.000 --> 58:31.000
After all, it's a very high compliment when someone wants to grow up to be like you.

58:31.000 --> 58:37.000
Literally millions of children wanted to grow up like Alan Shepard.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
Older kids like me still do.

58:40.000 --> 58:51.000
Because when he lifted off, he lifted us spirits and he inspired us to always explore the unknown and discover what's possible.

58:51.000 --> 58:56.000
To always think of the future, to always do up part.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
Alan was our soul.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
The poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once wrote,

59:03.000 --> 59:14.000
where a star quenched on high for ages would its light still traveling downward from the sky shine on our mortal sight.

59:14.000 --> 59:25.000
So when a great man dies for years behind his kin, the light he leaves behind him lies upon the paths of men.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
Alan Shepard lived to travel towards stars quenched on high.

59:30.000 --> 59:37.000
Today he is a star quenched on high and his spirit shines on.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
It shines on Louise and his family.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
It shines on America.

59:42.000 --> 59:51.000
And it shines on a space program that whether the moon Mars will be on promises to live by the words,

59:51.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I know it can be done that it's important for it to be done and I want to do it.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Alan Shepard, a brilliant star in the heavens will forever shine on us, NASA's mind, body and soul.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling, from glen to glen and down the mountain side.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:52.000
The summer's gone and all the roses falling.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:04.000
It's you, it's you, must go and I must abide.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:26.000
But come me back when summers in the meadow or all the valleys hushed and white with snow.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:38.000
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:01.000
But when you come and all the flowers are dying,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:11.000
if I am dead as dead I will maybe.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:33.000
You'll come and find the place where I am lying and kneel and say and obey there for me.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And I shall hear those softy tread above me and all my grave will warmer, sweeter be.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:09.000
For ye shall bend and tell me that you love me.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And I will sleep in peace until you come to me.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:59.000
And I shall be here in sunshine or in shadow.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Legion of fathers strong to save, who's under fight the restless wave, who gives the mighty ocean deep,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:47.000
It's all the points that live in this kingdom,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:55.000
O hero's when we cry to thee,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:05.000
For those in peril on the sea.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:12.000
It's all the points that live in this kingdom,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
O hero's when we cry to thee,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000
For those in peril on the sea.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:30.000
And be the planet and the sun,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:39.000
There are a point that all is wrong.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:47.000
O hero's when we seek thy grace,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:59.000
For those who saw throughout us is.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Amen.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Retire the colors.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Retire the colors.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Retire the colors.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Retire the colors.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Retire the colors.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Retire the colors.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Retire the colors.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Retire the colors.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Retire the colors.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Retire the colors.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Retire the colors.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Retire the colors.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Retire the colors.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Retire the colors.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Retire the colors.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Retire the colors.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Retire the colors.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.080
We knew him, of course, as a husband, a father and a friend, but Ellen was much more than

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.080
that.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:12.240
He has been is and always will be a part of our achievements and accomplishments in

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.240
space.

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.400
He's been us with us each step of the way.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:19.720
There are those that would say that our colleague is not with us today.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.720
That is not true.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.440
She'll bear with me.

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:26.240
I would like to read you the words that were written by one of the individuals that we

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:30.520
commemorate with trees, a tree and a scroll of trees.

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.920
These words that he wrote, I think apply very well today.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.040
Do not stand at my grave and wait for me.

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.400
I am not there.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.160
I do not sleep.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.160
I am a thousand winds at blow.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:45.120
I am the diamond glint on fallen snow.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.560
I am the scent of ripened grain.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.960
I am the stars at shine at night.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.680
I am the summer sunshine bright.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.440
So do not stand at my grave and cry.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:01.400
I am not there, or I did not die.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:06.240
Ellen Shepherd has been always will be a part of each step of the way that we take in

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.240
space.

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:12.040
And I got blessed, Ellen, and all his colleagues that we have commemorated here in this

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.520
grow with trees.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.880
I glad best God bless all of you and Louise, from you and your family, for all of you that

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.280
all have come today.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:27.280
Now Louise, if you will join me, we will go ahead and that.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:27.280
Now if you will please join me for a moment of silent prayer.

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.280
I am the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:43.080
he was profitable!

01:14:50.280 --> 01:15:13.160
That concludes this ceremony.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.040
Thank you all very much for coming.
