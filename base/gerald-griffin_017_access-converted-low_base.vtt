WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Now, wow, I got a 10, 9.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
We have this ignition sequence start.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
Let's go.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
Let's go.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, all engine run.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Look for the order look for the engine run.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Look for the order look for the order look.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
For the lunar landing, the Apollo Saturn V configuration consisted of two basic sections,

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
the Saturn V booster for Earth launch and departure to the moon, and a lunar flight system for operations at the moon.

01:27.000 --> 01:38.000
The lunar flight system consisted of two modules, one for lunar orbit operations and Earth return, the command and service module, and the other for lunar landing and launch, the lunar module.

01:39.000 --> 01:48.000
The lunar module consisted of two stages, the descent stage for the landing, and the ascent stage for the launch and rendezvous with the command and service modules.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
The lunar flight system was injected into a trans lunar trajectory by the final stage of the Saturn booster.

01:54.000 --> 02:04.000
Upon arrival at the moon, the command module inserted the combined vehicles into a circular orbit which passed over the landing site at an altitude of 60 nautical miles.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
Prior to landing, two astronauts transferred from the command module to the lunar module, the third remained in the command module.

02:11.000 --> 02:22.000
The lunar module then separated from the command module and at the appropriate point in the lunar orbit initiated the powered descent maneuver using the main engine on the descent stage.

02:22.000 --> 02:32.000
The approach phase of the lunar module powered descent begins at a point or high gate above and approaching the landing point where the pilot has visual contact with the landing area.

02:32.000 --> 02:43.000
When the lunar module arrives at low gate, approximately 200 meters altitude, it pitches forward to a near vertical descent during which the pilot takes over from the automatic control for the final touchdown.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
The time from low gate to touchdown is nominally about two minutes.

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
The planetary landing vehicle, PLV, is designed to replace the lunar module for delivery of very small payloads to a planetary surface.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
The PLV consists of two stages originally developed by the Department of Defense for ballistic missile defense.

03:04.000 --> 03:19.000
This direct conversion of Department of Defense technology to space exploration is enabled by the almost identical energy requirements of a lunar landing by the lunar module and a space-based missile intercept by DOD, Kinetic Kill Vehicle, KKV.

03:19.000 --> 03:32.000
This fortuitous analogy of equivalent energy capabilities enables the flight profile of the KKV PLV to overlay the flight profile of the lunar module with only minor adjustments to the KKV flight profile.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
The descent stage of the two-stage PLV is separated at low gate where the PLV landing stage is ignited for the final vertical descent and landing.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
The descent stage proceeds off-range for disposal.

03:45.000 --> 03:53.000
The final phase of landing in touchdown by a PLV was verified in an actual flight demonstration using a modified KKV test vehicle.

03:53.000 --> 04:03.000
This advanced concept architecture test, or A-CAT, was conducted at the Air Force Phillips Laboratory National Hover Test Facility on September 1, 1993.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
Kinetic vehicles, or KVs, are the backbone of rocket-dying's kinetic energy weapons program.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
A requirement exists to develop this defense system to protect America's assets from a potential foreign threat.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
A KV is a unique defensive weapon in that it can destroy a threat through impact alone.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
This has achieved at very high velocities.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Essentially, it's a smart self-propelled bullet with its own logic.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
And since the KV carries no warhead, we've been able to keep it small in size.

04:46.000 --> 04:58.000
A major milestone in KV technology was achieved in July 1990 when rocket-dying successfully hovered its advanced hover interceptor test for A-Hit Vehicle.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
It marked the first flight of a lightweight 38-pound fully autonomous KV.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
A-Hit, not only fluids mission, but acquired and locked on to a target without any commands from ground control.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Up until now, this had never been achieved.

05:14.000 --> 05:23.000
The test demonstrated the capability of a fully integrated vehicle, including all necessary subsystems required for KV operation.

05:23.000 --> 05:34.000
The rocket-dying now has a fully functional autonomous vehicle, whose size is ideally suited for current and future DOD programs, like the ground-based interceptor, or GBI, and brilliant pebbles.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
This technology also applies to other spin-off programs currently under consideration.

05:40.000 --> 05:52.000
Through our recent A-Hit test success, we've been able to prove that the KV attitude control system is capable of maintaining the kind of stability required in order to intercept an actual moving target in space.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
This kind of control is essential to an operational system.

05:56.000 --> 06:06.000
At the same time, we've demonstrated the ability of the visible seeker to acquire and track a target under actual flight conditions, and it only weighs 5 pounds.

06:06.000 --> 06:15.000
In an effort to reduce potential risk associated with the hover flight, we performed a series of attitude control tests in advance on the vehicle.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
They were the first in a series of tests involving the integration of several subsystems into one.

06:21.000 --> 06:31.000
The vehicle was balanced on a pivot while a disturbance was introduced. Using its pre-programmed logic, the vehicle quickly recovered its initial position.

06:31.000 --> 06:43.000
The A-Hit static test demonstrated a hotfire strap-down test of a full-up, lightweight propulsion system. All systems operated properly, and all test objectives were met.

06:43.000 --> 06:50.000
This was the exact propulsion system that was used to control the hover vehicles trajectory and position during flight.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
The result of all these tests represents a whole new generation of hover vehicles.

06:56.000 --> 07:04.000
Rocket Dine has gone from a 220-pound vehicle known as ON target to our 38-pound A-Hit vehicle in less than a year.

07:04.000 --> 07:19.000
We fabricated and fully integrated the vehicle with several major subsystems. These include the seeker, the image processor, avionics, telemetry, and the propulsion system.

07:19.000 --> 07:27.000
To convert the A-Hit hover test vehicle directly to a planetary landing test vehicle, only three relatively minor modifications were required.

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
First, the avionics guidance laws were changed to enable the A-Hit to perform a precisely controlled descent from its hover position.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Second, legs were added for the landing touchdown.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
Third, the A-Hit seeker hardware was replaced with a payload compartment and small surface payload.

07:45.000 --> 08:04.000
Using the modified A-Hit vehicle, the A-Cat flight demonstration on September 1, 1993 included the complete sequence of A, a controlled descent from hover using the vertical divert engine, V, touchdown at a landing point well within the capabilities of the lightweight legs, and C, ejection of the surface payload.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
The Alessis mission is designed to conform precisely to Apollo.

08:08.000 --> 08:19.000
The Alessis design reference mission is based on the use of a standard Titan II space launch vehicle to carry a cargo comparable to the Apollo Command Module and Lunar Module vehicles.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
The Command Module is replaced by a lunar service vehicle for lunar orbit insertion and lunar orbit operations.

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
The lunar module is replaced by the planetary landing vehicle, two of which can be launched by a single Titan II.

08:33.000 --> 08:42.000
The Alessis lunar orbit configuration, just as Apollo, consists of an orbiting vehicle and a landing vehicle, two in the case of the Alessis design reference mission.

08:42.000 --> 08:54.000
The orbiting lunar service vehicle is a conventional small satellite used for lunar orbit insertion and, after departure of the PLVs, communications relay from the lunar surface to the Earth.

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
Each planetary landing vehicle is comprised of a two-stage KKV in which the second stage carries the surface payloads.

09:01.000 --> 09:10.000
Similar to the KKV concept, the first stage of the PLV or descent stage provides the high energy portion of the flight profile.

09:10.000 --> 09:19.000
The PLV descent stage consists of an unmodified advanced liquid axial stage or Aless, a lightweight low-cost liquid propulsion system.

09:20.000 --> 09:32.000
The PLV landing stage is comprised of a modified lightweight exoatmosphoric projectile, or LEAP, and a payload system for deployment of specific planetary surface exploration instruments.

09:32.000 --> 09:40.000
The LEAP is a flight-qualified, fully integrated autonomous spacecraft having been demonstrated on several DOD KKV space test missions.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
The LEAP is a derivative of the A-Hit hover test vehicle.

09:46.000 --> 09:54.000
The landing stage payload system consists of four similar payload modules, each of which contains a separate surface instrument or device.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
The designated scientific instrument for the Alessis design reference mission is the autonomous Grindel micro rover.

10:00.000 --> 10:09.000
The Grindel is an artificially intelligent six-legged walker derived from three generations of predecessor mini robots.

10:09.000 --> 10:17.000
A flight-type Grindel will weigh about five and a half pounds. In its stowed configuration, it is slightly larger than a soft drink can.

10:17.000 --> 10:30.000
The behavior control software enables the Grindel to operate autonomously for extended periods performing a variety of functions in response to its surroundings, scientific objectives, health status, and other mission requirements.

10:30.000 --> 10:38.000
This adaptable micro rover can be equipped with a variety of exploration devices, including recently developed superhuman micro sensors.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
For transport and landing, the Grindel is housed in a landing capsule or cocoon.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
This cocoon absorbs the landing impact and enables deployment of the micro-rovers onto almost any surface conditions.

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
The Alessis mission begins just as a Apollo from a low-earth orbit transition to lunar orbit.

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
However, because a free return trajectory is not necessary, an optimum performance or a minimum energy five-day transfer is utilized.

11:05.000 --> 11:16.000
The Titan II launch vehicle was selected after a series of trade-offs as a balance among cost, launch capability, and overall mission performance margins to maximize the probability of success.

11:16.000 --> 11:26.000
Again, just as Apollo, lunar orbit insertion is performed by the Command Service Module equivalent Lunar Service Vehicle, a contemporary small satellite.

11:27.000 --> 11:35.000
At specified points in lunar orbit and depending on selected landing sites, each of the two PLVs performs an Apollo-type descent and landing.

11:35.000 --> 11:44.000
The Lunar Service Vehicle remains active in lunar orbit, functioning primarily as a data storage and communications relay between the surface stations and the Earth.

11:44.000 --> 11:52.000
Landing sites on both the near side and the far side of the Moon and located at any latitude can be addressed on a single Alessis-type mission.

11:52.000 --> 12:02.000
It should be noted that the Alessis flight system and flight profile can be applied to almost any planetary body, including Mars, Saturn's Moon Titan, and asteroids.

12:02.000 --> 12:10.000
As previously illustrated, the PLV approach and landing follows almost exactly the flight profile demonstrated on each of the six Apollo landings.

12:10.000 --> 12:21.000
The ALAS descent stage performs the higher energy braking phase, which is terminated at the low-gate step approximately 200 meters or about 660 feet above the lunar surface.

12:21.000 --> 12:32.000
At this low-gate step, the ALASis separated to continue downrange for disposal, and the LEAP landing stage is ignited to proceed in a near vertical descent to a hover position above the landing point.

12:32.000 --> 12:46.000
Again, it should be noted that the amount of propulsion energy required for the ALAS descent stage for the braking phase of an Apollo-type descent profile is almost identical to the propulsion energy required for a KKV intercept trajectory.

12:46.000 --> 12:58.000
Similarly, the amount of propulsion energy required for the LEAP landing stage from low-gate to touchdown is almost identical to that required during the tracking and intercept phase of a KKV flight profile.

12:58.000 --> 13:10.000
This conveniently facilitates the conversion of DOD-developed KKV configuration to a planetary landing configuration that is ideal for many types of planetary exploration missions.

13:10.000 --> 13:17.000
As the LEAP landing stage approaches the surface, it enters a precisely controlled vertical descent to the landing point.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
After touchdown, each of the four payload modules ejects its cocoon onto the surface.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
After the cocoon opens, Grindel walks away to commence its exploration activities.

13:29.000 --> 13:40.000
This final phase of LEAP landing and micro-rover deployment was demonstrated during the Advanced Concept Architecture Test, or ACAT at Phillips Laboratory on September 1, 1993.

13:40.000 --> 13:50.000
The flight demonstration of the modified A-hit test vehicle included a translation maneuver to a hover position directly above the landing point and a controlled descent to landing.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
The A-hit vehicle included a single prototype cocoon and Grindel.

13:56.000 --> 14:04.000
The following is a real-time ACAT flight video that was extracted from official video data recording, including the Control Room Test Conductor's Voice Loop.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
The vehicle pressure and temperature are nominal and holding.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
This is the Slander Launch Control. We're at T-minus 39 seconds and counting.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
