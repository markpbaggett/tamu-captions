00:00.000 --> 00:28.240
to

00:28.240 --> 00:31.160
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.480
I'm Tom Terbivill.

00:33.480 --> 00:38.240
World War II, of course, was fought primarily in Europe and the Pacific, but there was never

00:38.240 --> 00:43.600
any guarantee that the enemy from either side would not find its way to the United States

00:43.600 --> 00:44.920
shores.

00:44.920 --> 00:49.400
Frank Buill got permission from his mother to enter the U.S. Navy at the age of 17.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.640
That was in May of 1944.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.520
Just 15 months before Japan surrendered.

00:54.520 --> 00:58.980
While waiting for an opening to go to flight school, he was assigned as a bombardier flying

00:58.980 --> 01:02.400
B-24s and later PB-4Y-2s.

01:02.400 --> 01:08.080
Out of 24 crews, his was one of four assigned to stay stateside and train while at the

01:08.080 --> 01:12.680
same time guarding the East Coast from deployments, mainly in Florida.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.680
Please welcome Frank Buill to Veterans of the Valley.

01:15.680 --> 01:20.720
You're a 17-year-old kid and you were going into the Navy that kind of grew up fast when

01:20.720 --> 01:22.560
you go straight into the service, don't you?

01:22.560 --> 01:24.160
Yes, you do.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.560
You learn in hurry.

01:26.560 --> 01:30.080
But your mom had no qualms about going ahead and signing the permission and letting you

01:30.080 --> 01:32.680
join up at that time because there wasn't war going on.

01:32.680 --> 01:33.680
Right.

01:33.680 --> 01:42.080
I found a later that she hoped I'd go into the Army because she didn't like the Navy

01:42.080 --> 01:43.640
and she didn't like the Air Force.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.400
So I got both.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.920
There's one irony in your story.

01:48.920 --> 01:54.120
As we talked about in the beginning, you flew on B-24s and then later the PB-4Y-2s.

01:55.080 --> 01:59.880
You had previously worked at a company in Fort Worth and you were a riveter and actually

01:59.880 --> 02:01.360
worked on those airplanes.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.360
Right.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.360
Contended multi.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.840
And so that was ironic that you would later fly in those airplanes.

02:07.840 --> 02:08.840
That's true.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.680
Yeah, I didn't expect that.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.480
Let's talk about your service and sort of when you went in and sort of how you got

02:14.480 --> 02:21.680
to your final deployments or where you did deploy on the East Coast.

02:21.680 --> 02:26.760
You went to Jacksonville for boot camp and then from there we went to Memphis, Tennessee

02:26.760 --> 02:30.040
for Naval Air Technical Training Center.

02:30.040 --> 02:34.640
And I trained as an ordnanceman and radar.

02:34.640 --> 02:41.320
And then from there we went back to Jacksonville for gunry school and because I had a good record

02:41.320 --> 02:44.600
why they offered me mom and dearest training.

02:44.600 --> 02:50.400
And so I went to mom and dearest training in Cape Canaveral.

02:51.400 --> 02:56.240
I offered to go to Navigator School but they wouldn't agree.

02:56.240 --> 03:07.480
And then we switched to training for development or going to squadrons duty, flying out of

03:07.480 --> 03:15.000
Miami Naval Air Station and flying down along the coast of Cuba and out south of Cuba on

03:15.000 --> 03:22.480
East Puerto Rico and back through the Bahamas.

03:22.480 --> 03:27.240
Let's talk about that aspect of service during World War II because most of the people

03:27.240 --> 03:31.320
that serve in the war you think of them serving in the Pacific or the European.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.320
Theater.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.960
This was a very important aspect obviously of the war.

03:34.960 --> 03:35.960
Sort of.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.640
Were you surprised that you were in the crew that was chosen to stay state-side or were

03:40.640 --> 03:42.280
you figuring to go to the Pacific?

03:42.280 --> 03:44.000
We were expecting to go to the Pacific.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.460
We didn't know until we were all lined up and he told the crews that they would have

03:49.460 --> 03:57.000
30 days delay leaving on delay to San Diego to go to the Pacific.

03:57.000 --> 04:07.560
We were supposed to go to Rotta in the Quatcheline Islands or somewhere in the Africa now.

04:07.560 --> 04:13.360
But at the end he called off four crews and said that you're going to be going to the

04:13.360 --> 04:20.560
Atlantic and sent us to Norfolk, Virginia and we stayed there for a while and they transferred

04:20.560 --> 04:29.480
us to Eden and North Carolina to the Naval Air Station and went into Squadron 214 which

04:29.480 --> 04:36.360
flew the coastline, shipping lines, watching for submarines and weather.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.360
Talk more about that.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.400
What was the nature of your missions?

04:39.400 --> 04:43.040
You would go off, you wouldn't fly every day but when you didn't fly.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
What was your job?

04:44.040 --> 04:45.760
What were you doing?

04:45.760 --> 04:51.320
We just cruised the shipping lanes and looked for problems, weather problems or what have

04:51.320 --> 05:01.760
you and we usually went out for either four or eight hours and occasionally we would fly

05:01.760 --> 05:06.960
as much as 12 hours on a longer trip.

05:06.960 --> 05:16.140
But we would have certain sectors to follow when we went out depending on who went on

05:16.140 --> 05:19.200
four or eight hours or whatever.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.520
And we'd fly carry a lunch with us.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.920
Carry us up before we go out at night.

05:25.920 --> 05:26.920
Indeed.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.720
Well you talked about looking for weather and we'll talk about that in the minute because

05:29.720 --> 05:34.080
you flew into a couple of hurricanes which kind of dicey but as far as when you say looking

05:34.080 --> 05:40.160
for other problems, looking for enemy, looking for a German submarine.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.160
German submarines.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.160
Sure.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.160
I don't know if I popped up one time.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.160
Yes.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.040
Right off the coast where we were going to bombardier school.

05:47.040 --> 05:52.480
One came up one day and before we could get a bomb loaded on the plane he disappeared

05:52.480 --> 05:56.840
again and then they were in spotty mostly went out looking for him.

05:56.840 --> 05:57.840
Right.

05:58.840 --> 06:03.280
We had to do guard duty on the beach every night.

06:03.280 --> 06:11.040
Some with had, let's see we went on for four hours.

06:11.040 --> 06:19.200
Four hour shifts and walked the beaches carrying a rifle over our back and that was sort of scary

06:19.200 --> 06:20.200
too.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.000
We think of all sorts of things happening.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Exactly.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Exactly.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.560
You flew down I know to Cuba and there was some reconnaissance there because that's

06:27.560 --> 06:31.240
where some of the submarines were getting refueled and things like that.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.240
Yes.

06:32.240 --> 06:41.960
They had some creeks or little rivers where they'd run in under trees and do some stuff

06:41.960 --> 06:49.360
up in the trees to hide the submarine and they stored gasoline or fuel oil there and

06:49.360 --> 06:52.360
whatever food they needed and things like that.

06:52.360 --> 06:56.480
And they'd run out and catch the ships and the shipping lane.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.480
Right.

06:57.480 --> 07:04.480
As a matter of fact the only ship I ever sunk was one that had been hit by a torpedo and

07:04.480 --> 07:11.160
they called us when we were out on one of our flights and asked us to bomb a ship that

07:11.160 --> 07:15.720
had sunk down just almost to the level of the deck.

07:15.720 --> 07:21.880
They had had some ammunition and stuff stored on it, shipping to England.

07:21.880 --> 07:22.880
Right.

07:23.200 --> 07:28.480
They asked us to bomb it and sink it because they were afraid to go back on board after

07:28.480 --> 07:29.960
the crew had left.

07:29.960 --> 07:30.960
Where was this?

07:30.960 --> 07:31.960
Where was this?

07:31.960 --> 07:37.560
That was in just off Jacksonville, Northern Florida.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.560
Right.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.560
Right.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.560
So that was the ship that you saw.

07:41.560 --> 07:42.560
Yes.

07:42.560 --> 07:46.400
It was cargo ship loaded with ammunition.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.400
Right.

07:47.400 --> 07:51.800
I bet you can remember that day when you dropped the bomb and sucked the ship.

07:51.800 --> 07:52.800
Right.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.880
Until you had four right across.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.920
And did you get them with all four?

07:56.920 --> 07:57.920
No.

07:57.920 --> 08:02.000
One hit the ship, one hit right alongside the others.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.760
But you did the job, yeah.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.160
Talk about the aircraft.

08:06.160 --> 08:11.200
The B24 obviously a very high profile aircraft of World War II.

08:11.200 --> 08:20.080
And then sort of following it a very similar airplane, the PB-4 Y-2 which is also called

08:20.080 --> 08:21.080
the privateer.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.080
Yes.

08:22.080 --> 08:25.480
two planes and talk about the B-24 first.

08:25.480 --> 08:40.160
Okay. I don't even remember now how long the B-24 was. It was probably 50 something

08:40.160 --> 08:50.160
feet long, somewhere in that neighborhood. Wings were about 24 feet each way.

08:50.160 --> 08:57.400
And it had twin rudders. Right. But that's what's very distinctive about it.

08:57.400 --> 09:02.080
It's the twin rudders. We'll see. We'll see. We may have the head of nose and tail turret

09:02.080 --> 09:09.120
and one top turret and belly turret. Right. And then you could fire machine guns

09:09.120 --> 09:17.880
out the side windows. Right. And on the B-24 Y-2 it was designed to be 8 feet

09:17.880 --> 09:25.680
longer to leave an additional room for radar bombing gear and some other gear that they

09:25.680 --> 09:30.360
needed to put in for long patrols. Right. It had six turrets. Right. It had six turrets.

09:30.360 --> 09:35.960
Right. Running the nose, two on top, one on the tail and two on the side. Right. Right.

09:35.960 --> 09:42.560
And they would sweep all the way down and cross about 40 feet under the plane. Uh-huh. Crossfire.

09:42.560 --> 09:47.160
Right. So, right. It was much better equipped for patrol.

09:47.160 --> 09:52.760
And its tail or rudder was the more traditional. Yes. Single tail. Right. Right. Right.

09:52.760 --> 09:57.800
Right. Right. You liked the PB better. Right. Of course. The job that you had to do.

09:57.800 --> 10:07.520
Uh-huh. Particularly. And the nose, well the nose turret was a round turret that could go

10:07.520 --> 10:14.280
in the B-24, the turret could only raise the guns up and down and it turned sideways. Right.

10:14.280 --> 10:23.880
So, you had trouble tracking the plane coming down across. But, uh, you could, in the PB-4 Y-2,

10:23.880 --> 10:29.320
the round turret, the guns moved with the turret and you could go anywhere you wanted to with it.

10:29.320 --> 10:37.000
Right. And if you tracked the plane down and under or something like that, you'd wind up

10:37.000 --> 10:44.040
not going where you were. Uh-huh. And, uh, usually the plane would turn when we were practicing

10:44.040 --> 10:51.240
that. Right. Turn away or turn into a plane that was coming towards us and give more

10:51.240 --> 11:01.080
guns and opportunities to fire at it. But, uh, the, uh, gunner in front would get lost sometimes.

11:01.080 --> 11:06.920
And he could look around, couldn't see the airplane behind him because he was facing away from it.

11:06.920 --> 11:12.680
Right. And he'd have to just run his turret around to see, uh,

11:12.680 --> 11:16.760
right until he saw some part of the plane. Indeed. And then he landed that.

11:16.760 --> 11:22.440
I know you told me in the Navy that your, your missions were mainly single, single plane,

11:22.440 --> 11:28.440
uh, patrol bombing missions. We never went double. Right. Always went single. Yeah. And you

11:28.440 --> 11:33.720
usually stayed under 5,000 feet or around 5,000 feet or even lower. Generally, we were around 5,000.

11:33.720 --> 11:40.280
If we were running a bombing run or something like that, we'd go in lower because it was easier

11:40.280 --> 11:44.360
to hit the target. Right. You said sometimes you'd be so low you'd just be right over the wave

11:44.360 --> 11:48.440
tops because the submarines had a harder time seeing you that way, right? We had a

11:49.800 --> 11:57.880
altimeter setting in the Bomberdeer's compartment and the pilot had his above. And before we flew

11:57.880 --> 12:04.840
a flight, I always had to go check the pilots. Dealing set ours, uh, seven feet below

12:05.320 --> 12:14.920
his, his up on the dash and mine was down on the floor. Right. To the side. One day we went out

12:14.920 --> 12:25.400
flying and I forgot to set mine. And we were flying long for a practice run, bombing run. And, uh,

12:26.760 --> 12:33.000
I said, can you put it down a little lower? I said, you're up by 100 feet. Let's put down a

12:33.000 --> 12:39.240
lower. And so he dropped it down. And the water started blowing up on the Bomberdeers.

12:39.800 --> 12:47.560
And I looked at it and it was still showed that we were above water. No, it showed that we were below

12:47.560 --> 12:55.800
water. It hadn't been said. But we were close enough so that the wind was blowing the water off

12:55.800 --> 13:02.680
the wave tops and catching the nose of the plane. Right. Most time water on the windshield is

13:02.680 --> 13:09.080
rain. This was, this was ocean water coming back and back. Most of your missions, thankfully,

13:09.080 --> 13:14.120
I would imagine we're mostly routine, but there are some that were far from routine and you

13:14.120 --> 13:19.080
told me about a couple of them. First of all, I want you to talk about is the time that you were,

13:19.080 --> 13:26.760
you flew into a hurricane. Yeah. Actually, the Navy had never flown into a hurricane before.

13:27.480 --> 13:35.720
And they had heard about an army, be 17, that had flown into a hurricane and reported the weather.

13:35.720 --> 13:41.400
And so they alerted us at any time a hurricane was coming up or any of the ships reported

13:41.400 --> 13:46.920
hurricanes or something like that, that they wanted us to fly into it if we were close to it. So

13:46.920 --> 13:54.920
they sent us a message over the radio that there was a hurricane just south east of Cuba or just

13:54.920 --> 14:03.800
south of Cuba. And so we flew down and we're circling with the wind and going into it. And

14:05.640 --> 14:12.280
at first it seemed not too bad. It's we got into it a little deeper though. Sometimes we'd just

14:12.280 --> 14:18.680
drop about a hundred feet or 150 feet first thing, you know, we'd shoot up 100, 200 feet.

14:19.320 --> 14:28.600
And it really got scary. Several of us got sick. And with 12 members of crew there that smelled

14:28.600 --> 14:37.640
things that pretty bad. But we did go into the out of the hurricane and then flew right back out

14:37.640 --> 14:44.360
again and it was just as bad coming out as it was going in. But I don't know what the winds were

14:44.360 --> 14:53.000
because our equipment wouldn't measure them. Right. It didn't go high enough. But we did

14:53.880 --> 14:59.160
circle all the way around it then and flew back in. Yeah. And we didn't suffer any damage,

14:59.160 --> 15:04.120
but it was just rough. Really rough. Really rough. You said that was the second most

15:04.120 --> 15:08.680
scared you've ever been. Yeah. And a little while we'll talk about the time that it was the

15:08.680 --> 15:13.240
most scared that you were in your mission. Let's go to some photographs right now out of an album that

15:14.200 --> 15:21.320
you gave us. Frank Duel. And this is you and Gloria. Yes, that's my wife on wedding day. And

15:23.320 --> 15:34.360
that was in 1952. Right. We married. I met her in probably October of 51. Right. And

15:35.080 --> 15:39.240
when you all were at North Texas State. We were at North Texas. I was working on my master's and

15:39.240 --> 15:48.040
she was working on her doctorate in the library service. And we a friend of mine said,

15:48.040 --> 15:52.440
, hey, you would like to go to the ballgame this afternoon. I said, sure, Saturday afternoon.

15:52.440 --> 16:01.080
I had a football game. And he said, how about a blind date? I said, great. Sure. I'm up for a blind

16:01.080 --> 16:06.040
date. He said, well, I know a girl over one of the dormitories and I'll call our nasker if she's

16:06.040 --> 16:12.680
got a roommate or sweet mate or something. So she had a roommate. And we agreed to pick them up

16:12.680 --> 16:21.400
the proper time and went over and I parked my car and we walked up to the dorm and they were

16:22.280 --> 16:33.560
coming down to us some steps. And Gloria was 5'10 and I was a little over six feet. But she just

16:33.560 --> 16:38.440
kept coming down the stairs and coming down the stairs before we saw her face. I thought, man,

16:38.440 --> 16:50.040
that's the girl that's the one. That's the one. And so we met outside the dorm. She introduced her

16:50.040 --> 16:57.880
girlfriend to both of us and he introduced me or he'd introduced me to her and then she introduced

16:57.880 --> 17:03.160
her girlfriend to both of us and we talked just from you and I just reached over to Gloria by

17:03.160 --> 17:08.600
the elbow and said, shall we go and just walked off with her. And so you hadn't been paired up yet

17:08.600 --> 17:15.320
but you made sure the pairing was what you wanted, right? That's right. And he didn't like it at all.

17:15.320 --> 17:21.880
And here's some 57 years later. You still got her by the arm, right? And here we go. Let's go to

17:21.880 --> 17:27.160
some more photographs here. You're not in this picture. This is part of the crew, I guess.

17:27.160 --> 17:36.760
Yeah, there's the master mechanic and the middle one has radio operator and the one on the right

17:36.760 --> 17:45.240
is also a radio operator. And we had a bunch of pictures like this in places in that

17:46.360 --> 17:53.480
catch me but that's the way we went. Dungeries and now here is the privateer. Yeah, here's the

17:53.480 --> 18:02.360
privateer. This is the BBY-4Y-2. And in the nose, that's where the front gunner is, right?

18:02.360 --> 18:07.800
Yes, right. And you're actually down below that. You can sort of see the shine of the windshield

18:07.800 --> 18:13.480
where the bottom of the beer is. That's pretty tight quarters. You have to crawl in and stay down

18:13.480 --> 18:21.880
because you can't stand up in there. It's not enough room. And the white and the yield down

18:21.880 --> 18:29.560
underneath was our radar. I see. Here. Right. And we tracked planes with it. Got another photograph of

18:29.560 --> 18:34.920
the same BBY-4 airplane. Oh, that's the BBY-24. This is the BBY-24. Right, with the double hull.

18:35.720 --> 18:43.800
We flew BBY-24s until the BBY-4Y-2s came out. Right. Right. This is a photograph that I actually

18:43.800 --> 18:51.480
got off of the internet, which was a good, inflite picture of the BBY-24. And now here's another

18:51.480 --> 18:57.080
picture from your album, I believe, of BBY-24. That was actually in your group. Right. That was in

18:59.080 --> 19:05.960
training to go into Guadalupe and Didi. Right. Right. Okay. Next one. This is a... Okay.

19:06.680 --> 19:13.160
That was a bombardier school. And that was a bunch of the guys that were in bombardier training. Right.

19:13.160 --> 19:19.160
Right. And Frank, is the back row just almost right in the middle of the tall skinny guy that's...

19:19.160 --> 19:24.760
Dead center. Yeah, Dead center. You're standing... No, just to the left to the front. Right.

19:24.760 --> 19:30.200
Right. You're standing to the left of the guy with his hat that's caught there. That's you right there.

19:31.560 --> 19:38.280
Okay. Now you're on the right on this one. I'm on the right. Crawford in the middle and

19:38.280 --> 19:45.800
breaks on the left. Yeah. Where was this ticket? Do you recall? It's been a few years. It's one of our...

19:46.040 --> 19:53.000
It was one of our crude deals that I don't remember exactly. Right. Right. You were at ease while

19:53.000 --> 19:59.080
say that. We were at ease. You should see some of the pictures we had. Well, you saw something.

20:00.040 --> 20:04.600
Yeah, I did, but you were really at ease. Yeah. And there again, I'm Dead center. Yeah, in the top row.

20:06.600 --> 20:12.600
Section G of Class G8. Yes. From your office. Right. They were there taking the train center.

20:13.080 --> 20:21.480
Let's talk about the other time that was rather dicey moment. This one really was and it involved

20:23.080 --> 20:31.000
a flight where the normal pilot was on leave for personal reasons. And so another co-pilot had

20:31.000 --> 20:36.760
been brought in and they were being trained to go from the B-24 to the P-B-4Y-2. Right. Yes.

20:36.760 --> 20:43.080
And the co-pilot who was in charge pretty much the kind of loss control. Yes. Talk about what happened.

20:44.360 --> 20:47.720
We were doing various activities or various

20:48.440 --> 20:56.680
motions to show how the plane handled different from the B-24Y. And he was having us to do a 60 degree

20:56.680 --> 21:08.920
bank. And we went up in the bank and the co-pilot froze the controls. And the test pilot from

21:08.920 --> 21:15.640
consolidated Valtee that had tested the planes, whacked him in the head. I don't know whether it was

21:15.720 --> 21:23.160
fist or something and knocked him cold. And the next thing I heard, and I was in the rear of the

21:23.160 --> 21:31.560
plane listening to give him responses on the conditions and I heard him say, dammit push the nose

21:31.560 --> 21:37.880
down. Dammit push the nose down and then he whacked him and we rolled over on her back. And

21:38.280 --> 21:46.360
the plane dropped off and started spinning around upside down with one wing lower than the

21:46.360 --> 21:53.080
other. And we had been told that if we ever went into a spin that we would only last about two

21:53.080 --> 22:00.280
turns, two complete spins. Right. Well, I counted that and it was gone before we ever got

22:01.080 --> 22:06.840
over. But the pilot finally got the plane over so that he got it going nose down.

22:07.400 --> 22:16.280
And we lost about 8,000 feet and cleared off about probably about 400 feet.

22:17.400 --> 22:23.400
And he knew the plane wasn't flying right and so he just flew it right into the base and landed.

22:24.120 --> 22:29.080
We were just probably five or six miles out from the base.

22:29.640 --> 22:37.000
And it was a scary moment and the pilot didn't threaten his own skill for most of that when

22:37.000 --> 22:42.200
you got on the ground, right? We got on the ground and he got out and he said, okay, guys, let's

22:42.200 --> 22:49.080
kneel and pray. And one of the guys said, why were down? And he said, we need to thank God

22:49.080 --> 22:54.760
were down because I didn't have control of that plane. He said, God had it. Right. And he said,

22:55.480 --> 23:02.680
all I did was to hold it for landing. Right. And when it was on approach at about 400 feet,

23:02.680 --> 23:09.400
that's all he had control of it. That's right. As far as getting it on course, aiming nose to the

23:09.400 --> 23:16.280
right way. That's right. And we just happened to be lucky to be right, run on into the runway.

23:16.280 --> 23:22.920
Right. And he just came in landed. Right. And when we dug the airplane, the rudder has been over

23:22.920 --> 23:31.080
about 10 degrees. And there are parts of the tail and one of the ailerons missing off the plane.

23:31.080 --> 23:37.000
It had really been through it. So there was another time, Trip, I think, back from our two

23:37.000 --> 23:42.760
Puerto Rico. You said that a couple of engines went out. Yeah. Right. Right. We were flying. Yes.

23:42.760 --> 23:50.440
We were flying back in one engine went out. It had an oil leak or something went out. And then

23:51.240 --> 23:57.480
as we turned to come back towards home, another engine developed heating problems. And it went out.

23:57.480 --> 24:03.320
They're both on the same wing. Right. And so we were flying along sort of lopsided. But we flew into

24:06.760 --> 24:17.080
the Bahamas just almost just before dark. And the British had an air base there. And but they had

24:17.080 --> 24:25.080
closed their base down. Right. At summertime. Right. And so we came in over the island with

24:26.280 --> 24:33.080
a guy up front shooting a blinker, guy in signaling and the guy up on top of the yellow open

24:33.080 --> 24:42.360
and compartment there. And he was firing rockets out. And then the radio operator was calling

24:42.360 --> 24:54.840
us OS, SOS, we landed. Right. And we went over NASA and the pilot said, well, fellas, if

24:55.560 --> 25:04.040
if we don't make it this next time, we're having to go in the ocean. And so he turned and we came back in.

25:04.040 --> 25:10.200
And the lights came on just as we got over the island. And it turns out a guy had just come out of

25:10.440 --> 25:17.320
a club from having his last beer. This is all you all flashing at him. And he ran over and turned

25:17.320 --> 25:22.760
on the lights. I'm glad he didn't order one more beer. And might have been a problem. Frank,

25:22.760 --> 25:28.840
we've just got a couple of two and a half minutes left or so. And you got out in June of 1946.

25:28.840 --> 25:35.000
You were 20 years old. You went into education. You went to North Texas and got your degree.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.640
And eventually you got a doctorate. I know and all that. And you were in Carrollton for 20 years,

25:39.640 --> 25:45.320
teaching. Yes. Also taught it, taught all the way through. I was there 20 years, but I held

25:45.320 --> 25:50.040
almost every position in the district. And when I left, I was acting superintendent.

25:50.040 --> 25:55.240
You taught at TCU. You were an instructional consultant all over Texas after actually retiring

25:55.240 --> 26:02.200
at the age of 57. You met your wife Gloria at North Texas. You have a daughter Becky. And you

26:02.200 --> 26:08.440
have three grandchildren. Yes. And but one of your grandchildren, Wendy. And also wanted to mention,

26:08.440 --> 26:12.440
you have a daughter Becky. You and Gloria also had a foster child. A daughter.

26:12.440 --> 26:17.320
A daughter. Who, who, who said, Mary, who sadly you had to give back to her mother when she was

26:17.320 --> 26:22.680
young. But you have a granddaughter, Wendy. And tell us in about a couple of minutes if you can't

26:22.680 --> 26:29.560
about how you came by when. Yeah. Jessica's our granddaughter. And she was in the girl's house.

26:30.280 --> 26:40.760
And so the church here in town was sponsoring the Arfinage and El Salvador. And they got the

26:40.760 --> 26:47.240
girls to give, make up Christmas boxes for the kids. And they got to look at kids pictures and

26:48.600 --> 26:54.680
Jessica picked a cute little girl named Wendy. And she made up a box for her. And she stuck a

26:54.760 --> 27:01.880
picture of her in a letter and a Christmas card in it. And then several months later, long in the

27:01.880 --> 27:07.880
spring, Steve's builder. And they went out to see the building or builder supplies at the

27:07.880 --> 27:15.160
prizes center. And different things that were there about construction and building. And he took

27:15.720 --> 27:21.400
back in Jessica with him. And they walked down through the, the looking at things he was interested

27:21.400 --> 27:32.520
in, I guess, and Wendy saw the church, the, the, the, the, the, and up on top of some boxes was a

27:32.520 --> 27:41.160
picture of Wendy. Right. And she was holding Jessica's picture on her chest. And so they looked at

27:41.160 --> 27:48.520
that and they thought, gosh, what a pretty little girl she was. And they got to talking about it.

27:48.840 --> 27:55.320
You suppose we can adopt her. Right. We'd be glad to take another child. And it turns out that

27:55.320 --> 28:00.600
after a long, long process that took a few years, it's a great, great story. But three years,

28:00.600 --> 28:08.200
three years that they brought Wendy home. This. And she came, they came to our apartment. Right. And

28:09.240 --> 28:14.280
Jessica came running in with Wendy and Wendy just ran to us. And well, oh, oh, oh, oh,

28:15.080 --> 28:22.680
grandfather, grandmother and holding Wendy now. She's 10 now. Yeah. That's a wonderful story.

28:22.680 --> 28:26.680
Yeah. That's a wonderful story. I know you love all your grandchildren, but that's wonderful story.

28:26.680 --> 28:31.560
She's, she's quite unusual. She's special bringing her from El Salvador. We're out of time.

28:31.560 --> 28:35.800
Thank you for being with us. And thank you for your service. Enjoy it. Thank you, Frank.

28:36.760 --> 28:41.800
Frank Buell served two years and a month in the US Navy involved in the all important task of

28:41.800 --> 28:47.480
keeping our shores safe. He followed his military service with a career in education, which of course

28:47.480 --> 28:52.840
is one of equal honor. We salute Frank Buell for his service as we do all veterans. I'm Tom

28:52.840 --> 29:11.880
Terpaville. Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
