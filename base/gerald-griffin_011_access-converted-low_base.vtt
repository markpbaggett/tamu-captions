WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Requiring down for four, three, two, one.

00:07.000 --> 00:20.200
There are always steps to be taken one right after another, and what you do is you calmly

00:20.200 --> 00:24.880
and rationally, sometimes as quickly as possible, go through those steps.

00:24.880 --> 00:30.440
We were, of course, in serious danger of losing all of our oxygen, which meant all of our

00:30.440 --> 00:36.360
electrical power and our propulsion system would die also.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.640
The real story of Apollo 13.

00:54.880 --> 01:03.800
This is a very exciting summer in space.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.800
Hi, I'm Jeff Fox.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.200
In this time on Inside Space, I'm at the Space Center in Houston, Texas.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
Now think about this.

01:09.200 --> 01:13.040
Norm Faggard has been up in the mirror set a US record for time spent.

01:13.040 --> 01:17.920
He will be retrieved by the shuttle, which this time actually will be acting like a shuttle.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.760
And this summer, Ron Howard's brand new film Apollo 13.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.480
In fact, that's why we're in Houston.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.760
This is the weekend of the big press showing.

01:24.760 --> 01:29.240
And right here at the Space Center, just a whole exhibit of the things that went into the

01:29.240 --> 01:30.240
movie.

01:30.240 --> 01:35.440
But as long as we're going to meet the director and the stars, you might as well too.

01:35.440 --> 01:37.240
Apollo 13 flight controllers.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.240
Give me a go-no, go-for-lunch.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.240
Booster.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.240
Go.

01:41.240 --> 01:42.240
Retro.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.240
Go, vital.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.240
We're going fly.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.240
Guidance.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.240
Guidance, go.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.240
Surgeon.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.240
Go-for-line.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.240
E-com.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.240
We're going to fly.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.240
G-N-C.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.240
We're going to tell you.

01:52.240 --> 01:58.000
The hour's Apollo 13 might be the most historically accurate entertainment Hollywood has ever produced.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.240
Twenty-five years ago, the mass media had begun to present a work-a-day attitude about space.

02:03.240 --> 02:07.560
But according to the men and women who actually lived them, manned space launches were anything

02:07.560 --> 02:08.560
but predictable.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.720
It's nothing routine about flying to the moon.

02:10.720 --> 02:11.880
I can buy it for that.

02:11.880 --> 02:15.560
There were giants on and off the earth in those days.

02:15.560 --> 02:21.480
They had an M-A-S-N-S-M-A-L-L-R-D-E-O-D-A-L-R-R-T-B.

02:21.480 --> 02:25.640
Apollo 13 is based on an autobiographical account by Jim Lovell.

02:25.640 --> 02:31.440
Naval Aviator, astronaut on Gemini 7 and Commander of Gemini 12, he'd come tantalizingly

02:31.440 --> 02:33.520
close to the moon on Apollo 8.

02:33.520 --> 02:37.560
But when an ear infection bumped the Al Shepherd's crew from the third lunar mission, Lovell

02:37.560 --> 02:39.560
thought he had his shot.

02:39.560 --> 02:43.560
You know that Easter vacation trip we had planned for Uncle Polkko?

02:43.560 --> 02:44.560
Uh-oh.

02:44.560 --> 02:48.560
I was thinking there might be a slight change in destination.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.560
Maybe say the moon.

02:51.560 --> 02:58.680
Jim is a very competitive and driven and yet the same time completely pleasant and

02:58.680 --> 03:01.440
unobtrusive kind of guy.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.040
He does have everything very well organized.

03:04.040 --> 03:08.240
If you're going to be taking a trip with Jim, he'll do everything.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.240
He'll drive.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.240
He'll tell you when you're going to eat.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.600
He'll plot out the gas.

03:12.600 --> 03:16.480
He'll suggest when you can get a, you can take 20 minutes nap now.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.480
He's that organized.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.400
It's hard for me to recognize those qualities.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.160
I try to do everything logically and to make sure that we cover all of our bases.

03:25.160 --> 03:28.160
And that's perhaps what Tom was talking about.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.160
Houston, we have a main trust A-underbolt now too.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.680
It's reading 25 and a half.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.840
Main bus B is reading SIP right now.

03:35.840 --> 03:41.040
No packs in place Fred Hayes, a Mississippi-born engineer who had served in the Navy, Marines,

03:41.040 --> 03:42.040
and Air Force.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.040
Tell me a little bit about Fred Hayes.

03:44.040 --> 03:47.440
I found him to be very roofful, a good sense of humor.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.280
And I tried to bring some of that to him.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.760
He's a rocket scientist.

03:52.760 --> 03:56.400
I mean, these guys are aerospace engineers or build mechanics.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.320
He still had kind of a country boy sense about him.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.320
He was in a flying business.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.960
Yeah, he's in a flying business.

04:02.960 --> 04:07.280
The only military choice I had that would lead to a commission as an officer was the

04:07.280 --> 04:09.600
Naval Aviation cadet problem.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.280
I had never been in an airplane in my life.

04:12.280 --> 04:16.080
Had no desire to fly, but it was a way to become an officer.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.920
What was that gauge reading before you hit the switch?

04:17.920 --> 04:19.880
You don't tell me how to fly the damn CM, right?

04:19.880 --> 04:20.880
You don't need to do it.

04:20.880 --> 04:21.880
You do a job.

04:21.880 --> 04:24.320
Ask me to stir the damn tax and I stir the tank.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.760
I just asked you what the gauge was reading.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.680
Kevin Bacon had an additional acting challenge.

04:29.680 --> 04:34.440
His portrayal of Jack Swaggerd, an Air Force fighter jock, also making his first trip into

04:34.440 --> 04:38.520
space had to be based on other people's memories.

04:38.520 --> 04:43.960
The citizens of Colorado had elected Swaggerd to Congress in 1982, but he died of cancer

04:43.960 --> 04:46.760
before he could serve.

04:46.760 --> 04:52.720
Jack was just a new guy on that crew and I think he adapted very well and he did everything

04:52.720 --> 04:54.320
that was after him.

04:54.320 --> 04:59.360
I think that entire crew were absolutely superb to work with.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.680
Gene Krants was one of four flight directors on 13.

05:02.680 --> 05:06.080
He was sitting console during most of the critical mission phases.

05:06.080 --> 05:11.120
Gene is today as he was then exactly the sort of guy you'd want doing that job.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.680
Discipline, concerned with morale, he's tough, he's competent.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.680
The very definition of a mission controller.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.360
Krants is played by Ed Harris.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.760
He knew what he was doing, that's for sure.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.320
He was responsible for it all.

05:26.320 --> 05:31.760
One said, Rocket leaves the launch pad, you know, it's his baby, he's calling the shots.

05:31.760 --> 05:35.680
The flight director's got the responsibility during the course of the mission for every

05:35.680 --> 05:39.400
action associated with mission success and crew safety.

05:39.400 --> 05:44.840
This mission Apollo 13 very rapidly moved from the mission's success get to the moon and

05:44.840 --> 05:54.520
land on it down to a survival type situation.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.520
It's April 1970.

05:57.520 --> 06:03.520
America is fighting an undeclared war in Southeast Asia.

06:03.520 --> 06:09.360
In struggling with a cultural revolution back home.

06:09.360 --> 06:15.600
Nixon rules the White House, but rock rules the airwaves.

06:15.600 --> 06:21.280
And out of Cape Kennedy's launch complex 39, Apollo 13 NASA's first real lunar science

06:21.280 --> 06:28.880
mission is making ready for lift off.

06:28.880 --> 06:38.960
More Americans have walked on the moon and returned to walk among us.

06:38.960 --> 06:44.000
Some Americans are questioning the value of sending others.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.120
Many Americans are simply preoccupied, caught up in sweeping societal changes.

06:50.120 --> 06:57.080
As patriotism and uniformity fall out of alignment.

06:57.080 --> 07:02.120
Most Americans become comfortable with the space age.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.560
They've forgotten the danger.

07:04.560 --> 07:09.920
Forgotten the three years earlier, three American astronauts lost their lives, nowhere near

07:09.920 --> 07:15.120
space.

07:15.120 --> 07:20.240
Here are three guys who are always looking at death and in a job that even when you're

07:20.240 --> 07:22.360
just practicing, you can die.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.360
That's the stakes.

07:23.360 --> 07:30.120
The Apollo one really showed you what could go wrong and how dangerous this whole situation.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.080
It showed that machines will break down.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.440
This is what these guys were trusting.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.960
Not only the entire prestige of their undertaking, but their lives too as well.

07:38.960 --> 07:44.760
The fact that an engineered machine will work well enough to take them to the moon and bring

07:44.760 --> 07:45.760
them back home.

07:45.760 --> 07:50.080
We all know that we all have toaster weapons that don't always work the way they're supposed

07:50.080 --> 07:51.080
to.

07:52.720 --> 07:56.920
And one of the first things you think about when you see the Apollo capsule, especially

07:56.920 --> 08:01.320
when you stand next to it, is it's tiny, at least relatively tiny, compared this to

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
the space shuttle.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.440
This could probably fit in the space shuttle.

08:04.440 --> 08:08.200
And you had three guys sitting chic to jowl.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.200
Some believe them.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.200
Now when we come back, we'll meet some of the people who live through Apollo 13.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.200
So don't go away.

08:22.360 --> 08:47.720
And we're back on inside space from the space shuttle.

08:48.720 --> 08:54.720
And we're back on inside space from the space center in Houston, sort of ironic that

08:54.720 --> 08:59.880
this command module, or the command module for Apollo 13 actually, was called the Odyssey

08:59.880 --> 09:02.880
because the trip turned out to be quite an Odyssey.

09:02.880 --> 09:08.600
In fact, Tom Hanks said it says, great as saga as anything the Greeks ever put to paper.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.160
One of the seven greatest stories in literature.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.920
How do you get back home?

09:14.920 --> 09:24.440
I had been to see a launch.

09:24.440 --> 09:30.440
I found it to be this sort of immensely powerful experience.

09:44.920 --> 09:58.840
Well, launch sequence got named when we were in the full suits, which are not airtight,

09:58.840 --> 10:02.400
but you do have to have air pumped into it to an order to breathe.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.760
We're yanked back into those seats flat on our backs.

10:05.760 --> 10:09.440
And when they started shaking that thing, you know, and we're shouting out our lines,

10:09.440 --> 10:10.880
and there's a lot of noise going on.

10:10.880 --> 10:14.880
I tell you, I felt like we were riding it.

10:14.880 --> 10:20.160
The Saturn 5 is the most powerful launcher of its time, able to throw 200,000 pounds into

10:20.160 --> 10:26.000
orbit, it stands 363 feet tall, and weighs almost 6.5 million pounds.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.880
Its first three stages will walk to Apollo 13 into a 118 mile high parking orbit.

10:31.880 --> 10:35.400
The fourth stage will send them tracking for the moon.

10:35.400 --> 10:40.840
Several hundred miles downrange, second stage engine number five cuts off two minutes early.

10:40.840 --> 10:46.920
This is the worst they'll have to deal with on per turn.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.960
It's like we just had our clutch for this mission.

10:48.960 --> 10:53.240
Well, anything that you lose an engine in a launch phase, it's a pucker time.

10:53.240 --> 10:57.880
And I had, frankly, had forgotten that it cut off as early as it did.

10:57.880 --> 11:01.080
And those other four engines just continued to burn, had to burn a little bit longer, and

11:01.080 --> 11:02.640
used up all the same amount of fuel.

11:02.640 --> 11:05.240
So it ended up not being a big problem.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.400
And we kind of took things one thing at a time.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.920
We had the problem.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.600
We knew we'd get off that stage, we'd be okay.

11:11.600 --> 11:15.520
And we didn't carry it over in any way that it was going to be a precursor of anything

11:15.520 --> 11:16.680
that was going to happen.

11:16.680 --> 11:20.000
But we were ready to respond to anything that happened during the rest of the flight as

11:20.000 --> 11:21.480
we had to later on.

11:21.480 --> 11:26.720
For 56 hours, Apollo 13 smoothly obeys Sir Isaac Newton's laws.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.840
Lovell Hayes and Swiggard perform a customary live TV broadcast.

11:30.840 --> 11:35.960
But up against Dick Cavett laughing in the movie of the week, the Apollo 13 show is seen

11:35.960 --> 11:37.160
only in mission control.

11:37.160 --> 11:40.080
Okay, good evening, America.

11:40.080 --> 11:44.160
And welcome aboard Apollo 13.

11:44.160 --> 11:52.160
Hello, hello.

11:52.160 --> 12:00.160
This is the crew of Apollo 13, which everybody there, nice evening.

12:00.160 --> 12:13.000
With the TV show over, Houston has just a few housekeeping tours for the crew before

12:13.000 --> 12:15.280
they're due to enter a sleep period.

12:15.280 --> 12:20.160
One item is to stir the cryogenic tanks containing super cold oxygen.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.280
Not quite a liquid and not quite a gas.

12:22.280 --> 12:27.960
The oxygen will stratify and fail to flow correctly unless it's stirred by a small fan located

12:27.960 --> 12:30.480
inside the tanks.

12:30.480 --> 12:33.400
As command module pilot, it swigards job.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.080
We've got one more item for you when you get a chance.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.760
We like it to stir up your cryo tanks.

12:39.760 --> 12:46.760
Roger that.

12:46.760 --> 13:04.680
Roger, man, be on the boat.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.680
The explosion that took but a second was actually two years in the making.

13:08.680 --> 13:13.400
A faulty temperature controlled switch that somehow made it past all the checkpoints from

13:13.400 --> 13:15.480
manufacturer to launch.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.120
The levels crew didn't know it.

13:17.120 --> 13:21.880
One oxygen tank had overheated, a couple of stirring fan rotations and the pressure was

13:21.880 --> 13:23.040
just too much.

13:23.040 --> 13:29.280
But at the time of the explosion and the spacecraft, several controllers had single events that

13:29.280 --> 13:30.280
occurred.

13:30.280 --> 13:34.560
The instrumentation communications guy called up and said he flight, we switched from narrow

13:34.560 --> 13:35.800
beam to wide beam.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.320
We had a main bus undervolt.

13:38.320 --> 13:45.440
So there were indications of something showing up in many of the controller's console.

13:45.440 --> 13:49.160
And very shortly thereafter, you heard a crew come down and say, hey Houston, we've

13:49.160 --> 13:50.480
got a problem.

13:50.480 --> 13:55.680
But it really took us a while to decide what the problem was or how bad it was.

13:55.680 --> 14:02.360
We had been trained not to jump too quickly, not to do things too quickly until we were

14:02.360 --> 14:03.840
sure of what we were doing.

14:03.840 --> 14:08.160
And the problem that people were having in the control center is there was such a massive

14:08.160 --> 14:14.560
set of indications of a problem of a very large dimension that people were not sure

14:14.560 --> 14:17.480
that they could believe what they were seeing on their gauges.

14:17.480 --> 14:22.640
One at a time, one at a time, one at a time, E-commerce is an instrumentation problem or

14:22.640 --> 14:24.760
we're looking at real power loss here.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.480
It's reading a quadruple failure that can't happen.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.760
It's got to be instrumentation.

14:28.760 --> 14:33.440
They were searching for some common explanation which would help explain all of these crazy

14:33.440 --> 14:37.680
readings and one of those common explanations could be something wrong with the instrumentation

14:37.680 --> 14:40.040
system, some kind of electrical problem.

14:40.040 --> 14:46.120
And it's the most frustrating kind of problem that you can have as a flight controller is

14:46.120 --> 14:52.120
to know that the things are happening and you don't know exactly what they are.

14:52.120 --> 14:57.400
We're in a pretty large bank associated with the carcassia warning.

14:57.400 --> 15:02.800
Level kept saying it was kind of a fine spray, almost like a mist.

15:02.800 --> 15:07.080
I'm looking out the ads that we are, if that's something.

15:07.080 --> 15:12.120
But then it crystallized and stayed with them and then of course there were particles,

15:12.120 --> 15:16.280
mylar particles and pieces of metal from the explosion.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.920
We are, we are, we are, something out after the space.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.920
Right here we got your venting.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.440
Okay, can you tell us anything about the venting?

15:24.440 --> 15:25.440
Okay.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.440
What's coming from, what window you see it at?

15:27.440 --> 15:30.400
Coming out of window one, right now, Jack.

15:30.400 --> 15:34.480
I couldn't tell you today why I looked out the window but then that's when I saw the

15:34.480 --> 15:40.760
gassy escaping and that told me that we were of course in serious danger of losing all

15:40.760 --> 15:45.600
of our oxygen which meant all of our electrical power and our propulsion system would die

15:45.600 --> 15:46.760
also.

15:46.760 --> 15:50.200
Then when Jim Lovel came down and said hey we're venting something, then it was sort of

15:50.200 --> 15:54.040
like you had just got rabbit punch hit right in the back of the head and all of a sudden

15:54.040 --> 15:59.000
that says not only is this a problem, this is a survival situation we're moving into.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.240
So let's start thinking down that track right now.

16:01.240 --> 16:04.040
We were worried about water, we were worried about power, we were worried about oxygen

16:04.040 --> 16:08.720
and debris, we were worried about all the consumables as we called them.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.480
And my concern was increasing all the time.

16:11.480 --> 16:18.600
It went from, I wonder what this is going to do to the landing to, I wonder if we can

16:18.600 --> 16:20.600
get back home again.

16:20.600 --> 16:27.200
We now have shown altitude of 180,521 nautical miles in Mission Concord.

16:27.200 --> 16:34.200
We're looking, now looking towards an alternate mission swinging around the moon and using

16:34.200 --> 16:40.960
the lunar module power systems because of the situation that has developed here this evening.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.960
This is Apollo control Houston.

16:42.960 --> 16:47.240
With limited oxygen there's not only a problem with life support, there's also no way

16:47.240 --> 16:50.200
to make enough electrical power or enough water.

16:50.200 --> 16:56.760
In mission control, crans decides the lunar module must become the lifeboat home.

16:56.760 --> 17:02.440
Same to queries, the lunar module was designed to support two people for up to 45 hours.

17:02.440 --> 17:06.840
Now it must sustain three for almost double that time.

17:06.840 --> 17:09.880
For the crew of Apollo 13, the moon is lost.

17:09.880 --> 17:21.440
I'll say the immediate thing I had, a motion was just frustration and a sickness to my stomach

17:21.440 --> 17:25.040
and with disappointment because the mission was aborted.

17:25.040 --> 17:32.280
We had a cascading set of things that had to work right for our survival.

17:32.280 --> 17:36.360
The first was that the limb had not been damaged by the explosion.

17:36.360 --> 17:40.360
The second thing was to use the limb engine to get pointed back in the right direction.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.840
We were headed in the direction that would still have us an orbit today.

17:43.840 --> 17:48.480
Once we thought it was survival that we were going to have some difficulties getting

17:48.480 --> 17:53.040
the crew back home, each one of the controllers thought, what do I got, what do I got to save

17:53.040 --> 17:54.040
in order to get there?

17:54.040 --> 17:57.960
How can I cut a corner to provide a little bit more electrical power?

17:57.960 --> 18:01.960
So this control team very smoothly moved into.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.360
Let's figure out how we're going to get this guy home.

18:04.360 --> 18:09.920
Turn off the radars, cabin heater, instrument displays, a guidance computer, the whole

18:09.920 --> 18:10.920
SMET.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.120
Whoa, guidance computer, what do they need to do another burn?

18:13.120 --> 18:14.800
Jean, they won't even know where it's where they're pointed.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.040
The more time we talk down here, the more juice they waste up there.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.960
I've been looking at the data for the past hour.

18:18.960 --> 18:19.960
That's the deal.

18:19.960 --> 18:20.960
That's the deal.

18:20.960 --> 18:21.960
Okay, John.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.360
And then we finish the burn.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.360
We'll power down the line.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.360
All right.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.840
What kind of guy were you?

18:27.840 --> 18:31.280
Well, I think I was probably one of the most emotional of the flight directors.

18:31.280 --> 18:36.040
I generally would let my feelings be expressed very clearly.

18:36.040 --> 18:40.720
And I think everybody that knew me was able to read me pretty well.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.960
And I spent a lot of time with them.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.440
I could read them pretty well.

18:43.440 --> 18:47.960
Find out how to squeeze every amp out of both of these guys' machines.

18:47.960 --> 18:52.480
I want this mark all the way back to Earth with time to spare.

18:52.480 --> 18:57.840
We never lost an American in space where Sherrish Hill not going to lose one on my watch.

18:57.840 --> 19:03.720
You're quoted in the movie as saying that nothing like this would happen on your watch.

19:03.720 --> 19:07.800
That's exactly right.

19:07.800 --> 19:13.800
They, you have to take and put all of the mission experiences together.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.760
Many of these folks started off in Mercury.

19:15.760 --> 19:16.960
There was no piece of cake.

19:16.960 --> 19:20.240
We had a bunch of problems there, but we pulled it out.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.560
Came along Gemini.

19:21.560 --> 19:26.440
Gemini, we had the confidence to use the space systems we were given.

19:26.440 --> 19:30.880
Apollo, we had problems in the early days, but we learned the Sabhama.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.680
We got confidence in the spacecraft.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.160
We got confidence in the crew.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.280
We had confidence in the training process.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.680
We had confidence in ourselves.

19:37.680 --> 19:41.560
And that's what it took to get this crew home.

19:41.560 --> 19:45.560
Marvel, Hayes, and Swigart fight sickness and CO2.

19:45.560 --> 19:50.280
As Inside Space continues with the real story of Apollo 13, stay with us.

20:11.560 --> 20:26.880
And here's what the papers of the day said about Apollo 13.

20:26.880 --> 20:32.080
I think NASA put a pretty good spin on it the first day.

20:32.080 --> 20:39.280
As controllers deal with the cascade of problems, Word begins to spread about the troubled mission.

20:40.280 --> 20:45.280
I know you've deceived me, now here's the scene.

20:45.280 --> 20:57.280
For the crewmen of the Apollo 13, we'll hold silence for a moment, please.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.080
This was sort of hidden from us back then.

20:59.080 --> 21:03.560
Then if you look at the old headline from the Houston Chronicle, from the first day,

21:03.560 --> 21:07.960
it says, chances of return, excellent.

21:07.960 --> 21:11.600
Have we made a mistake by sort of holding this from the public how much danger that these

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
three guys were in?

21:12.600 --> 21:15.440
I don't think they wanted to create a sense of panic.

21:15.440 --> 21:20.040
I think that in a lot of ways, they're fairly lost about it.

21:20.040 --> 21:26.040
But the fact of the matter is by the time they did come back, it was pretty well known

21:26.040 --> 21:27.040
what was going on.

21:27.040 --> 21:32.280
I think the entire world really rallied around their safer turn.

21:32.280 --> 21:35.440
At the moment, the astronauts are continuing to try to isolate their trouble.

21:35.440 --> 21:39.720
The late report says the spacecraft now is operating on battery power alone.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.360
All unnecessary equipment is being turned off.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.680
It seems that the entire world is caught up in Apollo 13's flight.

21:45.680 --> 21:50.200
But in the flight control center, the size of Jean Krantz universe has shrunk to just

21:50.200 --> 21:54.080
the spacecraft, the astronauts, and the ground support staff.

21:54.080 --> 21:58.280
An important point to remember at this time, too, is the fact that we had gotten off what

21:58.280 --> 22:00.800
we call the free return to Jeffrey.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.800
We had done our mid-coarse maneuver some time before.

22:03.800 --> 22:09.120
And this meant that we were no longer on a path that would allow us to be swung around

22:09.120 --> 22:13.040
the moon and come back towards the landing spot on the earth.

22:13.040 --> 22:17.800
We had gotten off this trajectory because we wanted to go to our landing site.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.600
April 14, 243 AM.

22:20.600 --> 22:25.240
Lovell commands the lunar module Aquarius to fire its descent engine, the one they would

22:25.240 --> 22:27.760
have used to land on the moon.

22:27.760 --> 22:32.000
This burn will slingshot Odyssey and Aquarius around the far side of the moon and back

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
on a course toward earth.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.840
But not before consumables will run out.

22:35.840 --> 22:39.480
Apollo 13 needs a fast track home.

22:39.480 --> 22:46.320
Our second milestone was what was known as the Paris Cynthia Plus 2 burn.

22:46.320 --> 22:52.700
Because consumables were critical, we had decided to burn at about two hours past the

22:52.700 --> 22:53.700
moon.

22:53.700 --> 22:54.700
About 39 hours.

22:54.700 --> 22:58.400
I've been over it to shorten the time to get home again.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.400
The burn looked very good.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.400
In fact, it was an excellent burn.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.400
Our peak current during the burn was around 50 amps.

23:06.400 --> 23:13.280
Immediately thereafter, we gave the crew their initial power down information to bring the

23:13.280 --> 23:17.400
majority of the spacecraft systems down with exception of the communication system.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.280
Twelve hours are so part of the burn.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.880
Craft was mumbling about getting power down.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.520
He wanted to get power down right now.

23:24.520 --> 23:30.040
Deep slate was sitting over there and he just wanted to get the crew to sleep.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.360
We were keeping them up too long and all this kind of stuff.

23:32.360 --> 23:35.160
We finished that burn and all of a sudden three people.

23:35.160 --> 23:41.120
Craft comes down here, slate comes over and in through the door walks Max Fijet.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.760
They all want exactly the opposite things.

23:43.760 --> 23:45.800
Fijet wants to get into the spacecraft.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.600
He's worried about spacecraft thermal control.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.800
Slate wants crew put, sleep.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.360
Craft wants power down.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.560
And all were incompatible.

23:53.560 --> 23:56.360
And then, once later, the crew powers down the limb.

23:56.360 --> 24:00.400
They'll need to save all remaining battery for reentry into Earth's atmosphere.

24:00.400 --> 24:05.160
By 2.30 a.m. on the 15th, just eight hours later, the temperature and aquarius is ranging

24:05.160 --> 24:09.800
from 85 degrees in the sunlight to 22 degrees in the shadows.

24:09.800 --> 24:14.400
I went in there one time to go to sleep and Jack was on top of the couch and said, Jack

24:14.400 --> 24:16.280
put up all the window shades.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.880
Let's get the place nice and dark.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.880
We'll just relax and have it.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.480
Nice and dark in here.

24:21.480 --> 24:23.480
We can really get some sleep.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.600
I woke up a couple hours later and I was freezing.

24:26.600 --> 24:31.800
Eventually, the entire spacecraft got down to about 35 degrees Fahrenheit, which is about

24:31.800 --> 24:33.800
the temperature of a refrigerator.

24:33.800 --> 24:37.320
I recall that we went in there to get some hot dogs one day and it was like reaching

24:37.320 --> 24:40.320
into the freezer for the food.

24:40.320 --> 24:45.560
And Fred and I broke out our lunar boots, which we had stood away in the lunar module

24:45.560 --> 24:50.240
and Jack looked at us wet feet a couple times.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.960
And he had a next set of underwear so he put that on.

24:53.960 --> 25:00.960
The next most critical thing to me was that the vehicle stayed functional as we cooled

25:00.960 --> 25:01.960
them off.

25:01.960 --> 25:08.640
We chilled them down in ourselves for that matter, down to a below 40 degrees in some areas

25:08.640 --> 25:10.360
of the vehicles that actually froze.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.560
It was always to be forming everywhere.

25:12.560 --> 25:15.480
Frost was forming on the windows.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.920
It was getting cold.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.760
We knew they were desperately cold.

25:18.760 --> 25:22.000
We knew they were desperately tired.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.440
But again, we had our job to do.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.760
They had their job to do.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.560
There's little to do now, but wait.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.720
Shiver against the cold and try to rest.

25:30.720 --> 25:36.320
Lovell, Hayes and Swigart have to limit themselves to six ounces of drinking water each per day.

25:36.320 --> 25:40.600
This will not only conserve water, but reduce the accumulation of urine in the capsule.

25:40.600 --> 25:45.360
The only mistake we probably made throughout the whole flight that caused any concern and

25:45.360 --> 25:48.320
it wasn't real serious is that we asked them to remember.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.360
We asked them to stow all the waste.

25:51.360 --> 25:54.720
We told them to quit using the urine dump.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.840
So they started stowing it in bags.

25:56.840 --> 26:01.120
We thought we were told anyway that don't put any waste water dumps over the side because

26:01.120 --> 26:02.440
it might disturb the trajectory.

26:02.440 --> 26:07.400
And we're tracking you and we want to make sure that you can come back and hit the proper

26:07.400 --> 26:09.360
angle to reenter.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.640
We didn't mean for them to do that the whole mission.

26:11.640 --> 26:15.320
We forgot to tell them to go ahead and start dumps.

26:15.320 --> 26:18.680
We were dumping that stuff so by the time they got to the end of the flight, they had

26:18.680 --> 26:24.240
bags of urine stored all over that place.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.600
The long journey home is taking its toll on the astronauts.

26:27.600 --> 26:31.560
Fred Hays is rapidly showing signs of a deep systemic infection.

26:31.560 --> 26:35.240
Yeah, what I developed was a lower prostrate infection, which you can get here.

26:35.240 --> 26:38.040
I mean, it has nothing to do with space.

26:38.040 --> 26:41.440
And that was due, I assume, to the colonists, dehydration.

26:41.440 --> 26:44.120
So he had what they call a motorman's friend.

26:44.120 --> 26:50.040
It's basically like a catheter you wear with a bag and you urinate into that.

26:50.040 --> 26:55.360
He digressed into a fever and the shakes and by the end of the flight, he was in really

26:55.360 --> 26:58.920
pretty better shape.

26:58.920 --> 27:01.600
On board, the crew think they can breathe a little easier.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.400
They can see the way out of this now.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.400
But the mission management team is tuning into a new threat.

27:07.400 --> 27:10.360
The decision for life support isn't really the problem.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.120
Carbon dioxide buildup is.

27:12.120 --> 27:18.080
There was a felonin mad smiley and he's in the movie who quite early on recognized we're

27:18.080 --> 27:21.080
going to have a CO2 problem before too much longer.

27:21.080 --> 27:26.400
Both lunar module and mothership are equipped with canisters of lithium hydroxide to scrub

27:26.400 --> 27:29.480
the astronauts exhaled carbon dioxide out of the air.

27:29.480 --> 27:33.440
But because Odyssey and Aquarius are built by two different companies, the canisters

27:33.440 --> 27:37.120
from one won't fit the other.

27:37.120 --> 27:44.240
We got to find a way to make this fit into the hole for this.

27:44.240 --> 27:47.720
Use nothing but that.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.560
Let's get it organized.

27:49.560 --> 27:50.640
Okay, let's build a filter.

27:50.640 --> 27:55.240
We had this situation where you have a square cylinder and a round hole because of the

27:55.240 --> 27:58.920
differences in the two spacecraft.

27:58.920 --> 28:03.480
And these guys went off and figured out a way to get this thing done and tape it up with

28:03.480 --> 28:08.920
using checklist covers and plastic bags and in hose suit hoses.

28:08.920 --> 28:13.520
And the ground red is up for procedure in order to adapt some of the command module lithium

28:13.520 --> 28:17.280
hydroxide canisters for use in the limb.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.520
We read that thing we didn't have in those days today.

28:19.520 --> 28:23.720
We probably shoot that up with on a teleprinter and have the whole procedure.

28:23.720 --> 28:26.280
We had to read this very detailed procedure.

28:26.280 --> 28:28.040
Take a three foot piece of tape.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.040
Do this.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.040
Do that.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.920
They show in the movie and I guess level says in the book that they actually when they finally

28:32.920 --> 28:36.680
did it, they came and they ran right up to this desk where we're sitting here.

28:36.680 --> 28:41.760
He puts it on your desk and it's this contraption with masking tape.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.520
All by paper and masking tape and everything else.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.840
That is correct.

28:45.840 --> 28:49.680
Jim and I constructed one of these things.

28:49.680 --> 28:54.920
At this point in time I think the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was reading about 15

28:54.920 --> 28:56.120
millimeters.

28:56.120 --> 29:00.560
And we constructed two of these things and put them on line and I think within an hour

29:00.560 --> 29:04.480
the partial pressure of CO2 was down to two tenths.

29:04.480 --> 29:09.920
I think the thing that really was neat is that when we got the picture back from the

29:09.920 --> 29:15.000
lunar module, you got the picture back of what they had done, it looked exactly like they

29:15.000 --> 29:17.680
had the one we had built on the ground.

29:17.680 --> 29:22.320
The engineering team that we have supporting the flight operations that's called spacecraft

29:22.320 --> 29:29.920
analysis would always come up with some gimmicky kind of thing to figure out some way to work

29:29.920 --> 29:32.160
around the problems we were having on board the spacecraft.

29:32.160 --> 29:39.160
It eventually turned into a discipline we called the Inflite Maintenance.

29:39.160 --> 29:44.040
With no computers online, the crew of Apollo 13 must perform a never before tried manual

29:44.040 --> 29:45.040
maneuver.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.520
An inside space returns.

29:59.920 --> 30:26.100
This is the size of the lifeboat, the lunar module that saved the astronauts and take

30:26.100 --> 30:27.100
my work for it.

30:27.100 --> 30:30.060
Television makes things look bigger than they really are.

30:30.060 --> 30:35.340
Three guys in here, it's just the shame that this piece of equipment that saved the astronauts

30:35.340 --> 30:42.580
couldn't be brought back with the astronauts.

30:42.580 --> 30:46.780
A few seats away from the flight director sits the person in charge of trajectory and

30:46.780 --> 30:48.020
he wasn't a happy fellow.

30:48.020 --> 30:52.860
Apollo 13 is starting to veer markedly and mysteriously off track.

30:52.860 --> 30:57.780
No one remembers that Aquarius is built to vent tiny amounts of steam into space.

30:57.780 --> 31:00.420
Lunar modules are designed for short jaunts to the moon.

31:00.420 --> 31:06.700
A few puffs of gas wouldn't amount to much, but over a 200,000 mile voyage in zero gravity,

31:06.700 --> 31:11.860
a tiny repeated velocity vector can mean the difference between making it home and becoming

31:11.860 --> 31:17.020
a permanent monument to human confusion.

31:17.020 --> 31:22.540
In about 105 hours, the ground after some tracking realized that we were not on a trajectory

31:22.540 --> 31:29.940
that would get us safely back home and that we'd have to make another maneuver.

31:29.940 --> 31:35.620
To conserve power, the crew cannot risk activating the LEMS navigational platform.

31:35.620 --> 31:42.060
Electrical energy must be saved to power up the command module before reentry.

31:42.060 --> 31:46.180
This last maneuver was going to be unique because we did not have the platform powered

31:46.180 --> 31:50.740
up, so we didn't have a normal method of determining the attitude of the spacecraft in order

31:50.740 --> 31:52.140
to perform the burn.

31:52.140 --> 31:55.300
Because it was a manual burn, we had a three-man operation.

31:55.300 --> 31:57.420
Jack would take care of the time.

31:57.420 --> 32:00.300
He'd tell us when the light off, the engine went to stop it.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.020
Fred handled pitch maneuver.

32:02.020 --> 32:05.460
I handled the roll maneuver and I pushed the buttons to stop the engine.

32:05.460 --> 32:09.140
So hey, we ought to recommend a three-man LEM after this, I don't know.

32:09.140 --> 32:13.900
The control system was designed only to fly the lunar module and with that big mass was

32:13.900 --> 32:18.260
on there, the center of gravity moved way out and movements with our thrusters would

32:18.260 --> 32:20.060
not give us the same results.

32:20.060 --> 32:24.980
And we had to learn by if one movement of the thruster, what that would do to the actual

32:24.980 --> 32:26.820
change in the attitude of the spacecraft.

32:26.820 --> 32:34.220
You begin as a layman, you begin to realize just how challenging a lot of those procedures

32:34.220 --> 32:37.540
were for the manual burn.

32:37.540 --> 32:44.380
This is not like I just had to keep the car on the straightaway and make sure we didn't

32:44.380 --> 32:45.860
go over 25 miles an hour.

32:45.860 --> 32:54.460
I mean, this was something that had really never been tried and it was a life for death

32:54.460 --> 32:55.460
maneuver.

32:55.460 --> 32:56.940
The die is cast.

32:56.940 --> 32:58.540
There's nothing to do but wait.

32:58.540 --> 33:02.940
70 hours will elapse before the vacuum of space will be chased away by the home world's

33:02.940 --> 33:04.740
atmosphere.

33:04.740 --> 33:08.260
Fred Hays is cold, ill, weak and uncomfortable.

33:08.260 --> 33:11.980
Level and swaggered begin to worry just how this will turn out.

33:11.980 --> 33:17.300
You know, Fred Hays said something when we met him, he said, well, when there wasn't

33:17.300 --> 33:22.020
anything to do and there were hours and hours where there was nothing for them to do,

33:22.020 --> 33:25.820
he said that then it then it got, that was bad, he said.

33:25.820 --> 33:31.460
And they hear that coming from the guy, you know, that really speaks volumes.

33:31.460 --> 33:32.940
The car is not a bad thing.

33:32.940 --> 33:37.860
It's the human body's way of bringing all systems online to deal with a dicey situation.

33:37.860 --> 33:41.220
Was the crew of 13 ever scared?

33:41.220 --> 33:44.900
When you say scared, I think we were concerned.

33:44.900 --> 33:49.380
The thing that you have to realize is that it was not one of these out of control.

33:49.380 --> 33:51.900
Your car's getting toward the wall or off the road.

33:51.900 --> 33:55.820
You know, as time went on, we got more and more confidence in the fact that we get home.

33:55.820 --> 33:58.420
Did they ever think they'd run out of options?

33:58.420 --> 33:59.900
We never gave that a thought.

33:59.900 --> 34:03.140
As long as we had something to do, we just kept doing it.

34:03.140 --> 34:08.860
I think they have to, to a certain extent, try their best to put the fear of death out

34:08.860 --> 34:09.860
of their minds.

34:09.860 --> 34:10.860
We kept trying to say, you know, were you scared?

34:10.860 --> 34:11.860
Were you scared?

34:11.860 --> 34:15.460
What was like being scared, you know, and they kept saying again and again and again.

34:15.460 --> 34:19.580
We just wanted to work our way through the problem and, you know, run through the systems

34:19.580 --> 34:22.700
and, you know, we had a tremendous amount of help on the ground and we were trying to

34:22.700 --> 34:25.540
figure out what to do, you know, minute to minute.

34:25.540 --> 34:26.540
That's really the way they have to think.

34:26.540 --> 34:28.300
That's the only way to deal with it.

34:28.300 --> 34:34.020
All three of us do enough about the command module to know that this was not supposed to

34:34.020 --> 34:38.100
happen and that we were actually in very, very serious trouble.

34:38.100 --> 34:41.580
And I had two very competent people on board.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.500
Is he a right stuff kind of guy?

34:43.500 --> 34:47.340
I think they're the right stuff is just, they have become this kind of, I'm not too

34:47.340 --> 34:51.860
dimensional version of it, but kind of a quick identification kit for your average ass

34:51.860 --> 34:52.860
or not.

34:52.860 --> 34:58.260
I found them all to be in Jim particular, to be first off an engineer, a guy who understands

34:58.260 --> 35:03.780
the systems and knows that there are always steps to be taken one right after another.

35:03.780 --> 35:08.260
And what you do is you calmly and rationally, sometimes as quickly as possible, go through

35:08.260 --> 35:09.540
those steps.

35:09.540 --> 35:10.940
That's what Jim did on the flight.

35:10.940 --> 35:15.500
But even he himself, he told me and he intimates it in the book that there were sometimes

35:15.500 --> 35:21.500
there where the eyes rolled the back of his head and they honestly wondered how in the world

35:21.500 --> 35:26.580
did this happen to me.

35:26.580 --> 35:35.740
We are about 70 hours from home and we think we have the situation in control.

35:35.740 --> 35:42.300
We've projected the consumables as I've described and we have a plan for carrying out the rest

35:42.300 --> 35:48.180
of the mission, but there is going to be no relaxation at all.

35:48.180 --> 35:55.940
We've tried to simulate virtually everything that we've had the crew to do that is non-normal

35:55.940 --> 35:56.940
that they've done.

35:56.940 --> 36:03.100
And we've proven most of everything that we've been able to run on the simulator prior

36:03.100 --> 36:05.700
to passing it up to another maybe some details of it and that.

36:05.700 --> 36:09.300
But at least we've checked the feasibility of everything we've done and we're continuing

36:09.300 --> 36:10.500
to do that.

36:10.500 --> 36:15.180
In Houston, Ken Manningley, John Aaron and a team of engineers are inventing a way to

36:15.180 --> 36:19.020
power up the command module on the little electricity they have left.

36:19.020 --> 36:23.660
He came Manningley and flies the command module simulator for hours, improvising a score

36:23.660 --> 36:26.460
of switch throws for levels crew to play.

36:26.460 --> 36:28.980
But there could be no second take of this symphony.

36:28.980 --> 36:31.580
They'd have to get it right on the first read.

36:31.580 --> 36:36.580
And our main game plan was to keep on the plan and not make any mistakes and the squeeze

36:36.580 --> 36:38.220
to consumables.

36:38.220 --> 36:43.780
Gene's team, Gene had been off-console when he left at the time of the accident and his

36:43.780 --> 36:47.420
whole focus had been on what are we going to do to power up the command module, how are

36:47.420 --> 36:52.460
we going to make it safe, how are we going to configure it for our best odds for entry.

36:52.460 --> 36:55.780
Throughout the night and throughout the days, it's prior to this saying that ground

36:55.780 --> 37:02.060
of course was working fiviously with crews and the simulators and with the engineers looking

37:02.060 --> 37:11.040
at the systems to read up to us a set of procedures which we would be able to follow to make

37:11.040 --> 37:12.980
a successful entry.

37:12.980 --> 37:18.820
As they were waiting for this final checklist to come forward, it was sort of a race against

37:18.820 --> 37:19.820
time.

37:19.820 --> 37:25.140
Make sure it was perfect down on the ground so we wanted to keep time available to us to

37:25.140 --> 37:26.540
get this checklist right.

37:26.540 --> 37:28.980
They wanted to have some time to think this thing over.

37:28.980 --> 37:33.380
So it was really a question of making the call when it was time to go forward in this.

37:33.380 --> 37:37.660
And they were getting sort of, let's get that thing up here guys.

37:37.660 --> 37:39.020
What are you doing down there?

37:39.020 --> 37:43.340
If you had to remember that when we're back on the free return course, the flight was

37:43.340 --> 37:46.900
going to terminate abruptly when we started to hit the atmosphere and if we weren't prepared

37:46.900 --> 37:47.900
for it.

37:47.900 --> 37:52.220
You know, there was no go-around second chance so I was getting concerned that we wouldn't

37:52.220 --> 37:53.740
get the procedures up.

37:53.740 --> 37:58.100
By the time we got to the point where we knew we had enough consumables to make it and

37:58.100 --> 38:01.660
we had a procedure to get powered up and assuming the command module was going to come up

38:01.660 --> 38:04.420
okay, which again we couldn't do anything about that.

38:04.420 --> 38:06.820
It was either going to work or it wasn't.

38:06.820 --> 38:09.580
There were no alternatives if it didn't we were done.

38:09.580 --> 38:10.580
They did.

38:10.580 --> 38:12.580
They read us up procedures.

38:12.580 --> 38:19.140
Fred, Jack and I practice these procedures by reading them and then completed them.

38:19.140 --> 38:24.460
I think it's amazing the way that people can respond so fast to get this job done.

38:24.460 --> 38:26.940
Odyssey is alive and online again.

38:26.940 --> 38:30.460
The crew prepares to jettison the service module.

38:30.460 --> 38:33.260
For the first time they'll see the extent of the damage.

38:33.260 --> 38:49.780
It was to me sort of an amazing sight.

38:49.780 --> 38:57.580
I didn't realize that this whole panel by the high gain antenna was blown clean off,

38:57.580 --> 39:04.780
but along the area where the panel normally swings open.

39:04.780 --> 39:10.020
The moment has come to cast off Aquarius, she was built for space and to space she must

39:10.020 --> 39:16.420
be released.

39:16.420 --> 39:18.260
The voyage is almost over.

39:18.260 --> 39:23.940
Ironically, the very atmosphere which promises air and life also represents a barrier to

39:23.940 --> 39:24.940
cross.

39:24.940 --> 39:27.060
Basically, it comes down to this question.

39:27.060 --> 39:30.260
Has Odyssey's heat shield been damaged by the explosion?

39:30.260 --> 39:34.540
Will it withstand the plunge through the Earth's atmosphere?

39:34.540 --> 39:38.500
By this point in the space age, most people know that communications with capsules are

39:38.500 --> 39:49.140
impossible during the last fiery plunge, but it usually only takes three minutes.

39:49.140 --> 39:59.140
So we sat there for a while, continuing the hard-to-deaf patient waiting.

39:59.140 --> 40:05.260
The blackout period was extended and for some reason that we don't know why today,

40:05.260 --> 40:09.340
instead of being in blackout for about three minutes we were in this blackout communications

40:09.340 --> 40:11.340
phase for about four minutes.

40:11.340 --> 40:30.380
The very technologies which allow Earth to talk to space cloud, now flash television

40:30.380 --> 40:37.740
pictures around the world as Apollo 13 splashes into the Pacific Ocean.

40:37.740 --> 40:40.860
For level haze and swagger, the Odyssey is over.

40:40.860 --> 40:47.140
I think I can quickly say that, never every four in the history of man, that more people

40:47.140 --> 40:56.860
watch together, pray together, and rejoice together at your safe return that on this occasion.

40:56.860 --> 41:02.500
Safely aboard the USS Iwo Jima, Apollo 13's gym level sends a message on behalf of his crew

41:02.500 --> 41:05.580
to the men and women who safely guided them home.

41:05.580 --> 41:06.580
It reads,

41:07.580 --> 41:12.780
Words cannot express the praise we have for all the personnel of the mission control

41:12.780 --> 41:18.260
whose dedicated efforts provided a successful conclusion to Apollo 13.

41:18.260 --> 41:29.820
Our deepest and heartfelt thanks, sign gym level, jack swagger and Fred haze.

41:29.820 --> 41:34.660
Putting Apollo 13 in perspective, when we come back with more inside space in just a minute,

41:34.660 --> 41:35.660
don't go away.

42:05.660 --> 42:16.860
And we're back on inside space looking at Apollo 13 from the space center here in Houston.

42:16.860 --> 42:19.620
Now here's a movie that we all know the ending of.

42:19.620 --> 42:24.860
I mean the guys come back safe and sound and yet it's very exciting with all sorts of

42:24.860 --> 42:28.220
revelations and lots and lots of plot twists.

42:28.220 --> 42:34.820
And yet it's a movie with no guns, no gore, no violence and yet very compelling which

42:34.820 --> 42:38.380
is what I asked director Ron Howard about.

42:38.380 --> 42:47.620
Here you have this incredible action movie, no guns, no gore, no violence and very limited

42:47.620 --> 42:48.620
sex.

42:48.620 --> 42:51.340
No villains.

42:51.340 --> 42:52.540
It's a great story.

42:52.540 --> 42:58.060
It's a great story and it's not really about bad guys and conflict and it's, you know,

42:58.060 --> 42:59.580
there's the greatest conflict.

42:59.580 --> 43:00.780
Are they going to make it?

43:00.780 --> 43:04.380
And more importantly, how in the world that they pull it off?

43:04.380 --> 43:13.260
They're trained to solve problems and you know, you listen to the tapes of any pilot who's

43:13.260 --> 43:19.580
going down and you don't hear screaming and carrying on and panic very often.

43:19.580 --> 43:23.380
Usually you hear them working the problem, particularly the military pilots that highly

43:23.380 --> 43:27.060
train pilots until the very last instant.

43:27.060 --> 43:30.580
So a few guys were given the opportunity to do it for real.

43:30.580 --> 43:31.580
Would you?

43:31.580 --> 43:38.260
I would have done it anyway if they said you got to put your career on hold, you got to

43:38.260 --> 43:41.340
give two years of the program, you got to go through all the training, you might not be

43:41.340 --> 43:43.740
able to get to fly but we're going to try to make it work out.

43:43.740 --> 43:44.740
Would you do it?

43:44.740 --> 43:45.740
I would, I'd do it.

43:45.740 --> 43:46.740
Better be careful what you say.

43:46.740 --> 43:47.740
Well, it wouldn't be the problem.

43:47.740 --> 43:48.740
It's not a call.

43:48.740 --> 43:51.540
The service of my country, I'd do it.

43:51.540 --> 43:56.260
We have a lot of heroes now that seem to have, you know, gone the wrong way and I hate

43:56.260 --> 44:05.180
to have kids follow the actions of previous famous people who are now in deep trouble.

44:05.180 --> 44:10.060
I hopefully that the children of today look carefully at the type of people they want

44:10.060 --> 44:16.060
to follow and to emulate and pick the right people.

44:16.060 --> 44:20.300
Ashenots have in the past been a role model for children.

44:20.300 --> 44:27.700
We did move forward as boldly and aggressively into the next arena which was really to take

44:27.700 --> 44:28.700
and live in space.

44:28.700 --> 44:32.660
I think we sort of surrendered after the Skylab program.

44:32.660 --> 44:34.900
We got the enamored of transportation.

44:34.900 --> 44:39.380
We need transportation but we should have always had that outpost in space going.

44:39.380 --> 44:43.780
The managers at that time I self included lots of people in the United States down by

44:43.780 --> 44:51.780
not being much more aggressive in articulating the use of space, the need for our country

44:51.780 --> 44:58.180
to continue the process of exploration, the need to challenge our youth.

44:58.180 --> 45:01.820
All of these things we just took for granted that someone is going to speak for us.

45:01.820 --> 45:05.020
We should have spoken for ourselves.

45:05.020 --> 45:08.180
You know, even to this day when you talk to the people at the Johnson Space Center, they

45:08.180 --> 45:12.140
talk about some of the lessons that were learned on Apollo 13.

45:12.140 --> 45:17.060
One of them is that when you send people in the space, it's just a very risky thing.

45:17.060 --> 45:21.420
But if you take people who are bright and who know their business and let them set their

45:21.420 --> 45:25.860
minds to any problem, they can do just about anything.

45:25.860 --> 45:28.900
So what should we do to go back in the space?

45:28.900 --> 45:33.340
Should we send people again and take that risk or should we use mechanized units to go

45:33.340 --> 45:34.340
there?

45:34.340 --> 45:35.340
We'd like to know how you feel.

45:35.340 --> 45:36.660
You can drop us a line.

45:36.660 --> 45:41.940
It's inside space, USA Network Sci-Fi Channel, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York,

45:41.940 --> 45:48.100
1.002.0, or on the internet at inspaceatusanetworks.com.

45:48.100 --> 45:50.380
I saw Apollo 13 last night.

45:50.380 --> 45:52.580
It was a great movie.

45:52.580 --> 45:53.580
And I cried.

45:53.580 --> 46:00.220
And my wife sitting on my right, cried, and a producer sitting on my left, cried.

46:00.220 --> 46:05.420
It's amazing how a movie where you know the ending can still evoke so much emotion.

46:05.420 --> 46:09.500
Well, I'm Jeff Fox from the Space Center in Houston.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.500
And I'll see you next time inside space.

46:11.500 --> 46:16.500
13 stand by for staging.

46:16.500 --> 46:19.500
Look at that.

46:19.500 --> 46:23.500
13 stand by for staging.

46:23.500 --> 46:24.500
Look at that.

46:24.500 --> 46:25.500
13 stand by for staging.

46:25.500 --> 46:26.500
Look at that.

46:26.500 --> 46:27.500
13 stand by for staging.

46:27.500 --> 46:28.500
13 stand by for staging.

46:28.500 --> 46:29.500
Look at that.

46:29.500 --> 46:30.500
13 stand by for staging.

46:30.500 --> 46:31.500
Look at that.

46:31.500 --> 46:32.500
13 stand by for staging.

46:32.500 --> 46:33.500
Look at that.

46:33.500 --> 46:34.500
13 stand by for staging.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.500
13 stand by for staging.

46:35.500 --> 46:36.500
13 stand by for staging.

46:36.500 --> 46:37.500
13 stand by for staging.

46:37.500 --> 46:40.500
That off is 12 plus 3, 4 over.

46:40.500 --> 46:44.500
Coming up on 12 minutes 34.

46:44.500 --> 46:47.500
And say go.

46:47.500 --> 46:48.500
Cut down.

46:48.500 --> 46:54.500
And that, you know, then, is how we knew that.
