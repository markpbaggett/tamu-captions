00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I'm going to play a song for you.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
I'm Tom Turboville.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Meet major Kurt Burns and Airman

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
with plenty of passion and little fear.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Texas A&M Class of 1952.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
He grew up in a home located about where G.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Raleigh White Coliseum stands today.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
This Aggie was a proud flyer who piloted five different

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
jet fighters during his service in Europe and then Vietnam.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
In all nearly 5,000 hours of flying time

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
in more than 20 years as an Air Force pilot.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
He still serves the school he loves so nearly today.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
As coach of the A&M Pistol team,

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
meet the multi-talented Kurt Burns of Brian.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Major Burns, it's a pleasure to have you here.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
I want to talk first about growing up on the Texas A&M campus

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
in the mid to late 30s.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
That must have been quite an experience.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
That was back when they had a pretty good football team even back then.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
One of National Championship two years later.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
You look through the not-hold-a-watch John Kimbrough practice

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
and play, right?

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
Well, during the time that the team was practicing playing,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
every day during football season after school.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I was in A&M consolidated.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
And I would go over to the practice field and watch and practice.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
And I saw all the home games.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
And as a matter of fact, I saw the home games probably from 1937 until

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
I left a graduate of A&M and left in 52.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
And then after I came back in 72.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
The campus was quite a bit different then.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Kyle Field was just a small little one-stack stadium.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
And actually, you lived on campus because your father was a professor at the time.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
And most of the faculty lived on campus at that time, right?

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
Well, I believe it was an apartment head and deans in higher.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
And my father had been head of the department of physiology and pharmacology

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
for the College of other at that time in school, about your medicine.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Right.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
You were born in Brian.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
You went to A&M Consolidate that your freshman year in high school.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
Then went to Steven F. Austin, which is now Brian High, later on.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
And went on to Texas saying,

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I was going to be an M. Graduated in 1952.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
And that's about the time the Korean War was going on.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
So it didn't take long for you to go into active service with the Air Force.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Sort of take us through that time.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Well, when I graduated, I was an IRFORCE ROTC.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
And had thoughts about being a pilot that were generated generally during World War II

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
when I was following the War very closely.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
And I'd picture the very things all of them along in my room.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
And so I came on active in 1952.

03:13.000 --> 03:22.000
It took them Air Force about a year to get me into a class in flying school.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
At the time I was at this hardship position or location,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I was stationed at Palm Beach International Airport.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
They had a military transport service training base down there.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
They trained pilots for C-124s and C-97s and SA-16s.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
And I'd go scrounge rides with pilots as often as I could get off from my work.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
Anyway, then I got into flying school with the Barto Air Base,

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
which is a primary contract field in Barto, Florida, about in the middle of the state.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I flew the T-6G.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I loved the T-6.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I thought an outstanding training plane.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
I always thought if a person could learn to fly a master of the T-6, he'd fly anything.

04:12.000 --> 04:20.000
And after that, I was relatively high up in my class and got my choice.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
And I chose Brian for a basic go into jets.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
You told me that was interesting.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
You said that the class, the top half of the class, got to go to jets.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
And the bottom half of the class went to fixed wings.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
That's true, except for one person in there who had been a SAC navigator in the strategic air command.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
His goal was to go to multi-engine training and get into the at that time.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
Very new, KC-135s, put in his normal or his required commitment, good work for airlines.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Nothing wrong with that.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
He did achieve that.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
I was in the top 30 to jet bases.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
And I got the chance to come back here to Brian and do my training.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
That was in the early 50s.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I guess you graduated.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
That was September of 53 until September of 54.

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
Right. When you finished flying school, like we said in the outset, you flew, I think, five different to jet fighters.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Let's talk about the F-86 because we're going to see a lot of that.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
That was my favorite airplane.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
My favorite fighter of any.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
It was very, I called it a pussycat.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
You could have gotten trouble.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
If you misshandle the airplane, you could get real trouble.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
If you flew it like a fighter ought to be flown, it was very forgiving airplane.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Had relatively few emergencies in the airplane.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
A couple of them.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Well, I had smoked the cockpit on a copep with one time right now.

05:56.000 --> 06:05.000
Another time I had trouble getting the nose gear down, but I got held the emergency, landed out and got it landed okay.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
But I was fortunate after flying school to have my choice.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
I, and I from the class tour, I was able to choose F-86.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
It was a choice assignment.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
It was a choice to assignment from basic at the time.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Let's move on.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I know later on you took your first of what would be two tours of Germany.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Let's talk about the first time that you went to Ramstein and you were...

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
Well, I had been instructing F-86's at Williams Air Force Base in Arizona.

06:32.000 --> 06:42.000
And I got this really plumb of an assignment to the 53rd fighter day squadron in what is now Ramstein Air Base Germany.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
And in those days, fighter day was air defense, and that was the...

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
...pittacle of a fighter pilot's assignment.

06:51.000 --> 07:01.000
And had about half the tour there at Ramstein in air defense as the day fighter pilot in the F-100C.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
The F-100C was probably the best day fighter they had at that time.

07:07.000 --> 07:21.000
And then they reconfigured the whole wing, including our squadron, as a nuclear strike mission.

07:21.000 --> 07:31.000
And it spent the last half of my tour in the 53rd, basically training for and sitting alert on Tomic Bomb.

07:31.000 --> 07:43.000
And with task for tactical missions in East Germany and Teklasovakia, and I had one tour.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
It was in Soviet Union.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Right.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
I want to backtrack just a little bit back to when you were at Texas A&M in a senior in 1952, right at Eastern 1952.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Before you graduated, you married your wife Ann.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yes.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
And special moment in your life, and you all are still married.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
I know that you've been married for 54 years.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
How about that?

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
You came back, I believe, to a Moody Air Force base.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Talk about the MAPS program.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Military assistant pack.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Okay.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
It was a very interesting part of your career.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
After flying F-100C in Germany, I came back to our training command.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
And I was able to get into what they called a MAP pilot training program.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
MAP stands for Military Assistant Packed.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
We trained pilots from 26 different nations.

08:27.000 --> 08:36.000
And supposedly all friendly nations, although I can think of about three or four of those countries that

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
pilots went back with flu migs.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
But the minority of our students were Vietnamese.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
South Vietnamese started this in 1961.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Right.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
And hardly anybody else outside of the military knew what Vietnam was in those days.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
I stayed in this squad for almost five years.

08:58.000 --> 09:07.000
And it was one of the more rewarding tours that I flew, even though I was training in a propeller driven trainer, the T-28.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
But I felt like I was achieving something worthwhile.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
So in the early 60s, you became very familiar with the South Vietnamese people.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
And the way the insurgency was going in Vietnam.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Right.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Right.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
Before really any of the general public really were really aware about the South Vietnamese or what their struggles were, what was about to happen.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
True.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Obviously.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
But then later on you were deployed to Vietnam.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Yes.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
And you thought you were going to probably be going out of country, but turns out you were in the country.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
That was just a win.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
I went through a four transition at Davis, Mothin.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I had volunteered for Vietnam.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
And what I had hoped was to go to either U-Bahn or U-Dorn in Thailand.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
And they were the ones that went out and chased me.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
And supported the also bond over North Vietnam.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
But as the luck of the draw of the Air Force decided they wanted me to go in country to Camarand Bay.

10:08.000 --> 10:16.000
And the twelfth tech fighter wing was the F4, well I had two F4 wings.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
The other was at the name.

10:18.000 --> 10:31.000
But we did missions in country and luck was such that I never went out country and never went mission in the North.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Right.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
So your day-to-day job was to fly the fighters.

10:35.000 --> 10:44.000
And you said that in combat situations you didn't have what you would describe as many terrifying moments.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
But you described one terrifying moment that actually happened that wasn't in a combat situation.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
That's true.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
I spent about a month or so in Korea.

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
After the North Korean had hijacked our intelligence ship the Pueblo.

11:02.000 --> 11:09.000
And the Air Force sent a couple of wings from the States and had squadron up from Vietnam.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
And our mission was air defense with the F4C.

11:16.000 --> 11:31.000
And we were loaded with four side-winder missiles, four spare missiles, and a gun pod with 1100 rounds of 20 millimeter ammunition for the Gatling gun underneath.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
So we were loaded for bear.

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
But what you were talking about, the mission that just terrified me.

11:41.000 --> 11:49.000
And I guess what it was, I actually woke up from a scramble passing through 5,000 feet.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Apparently I was in an Alpha State or something.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
But I do remember the middle of the night.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
And the middle of the night is 3 o'clock 3 a.m. in the morning.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
I was from a dead sleep.

11:57.000 --> 12:07.000
I didn't remember the clocks and horn waking me up or putting my boots with a lacing of boots up and our zipping them up and running out the airplane starting it up.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
And the back seat at all the radio works.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
But I was the flight leader so I had a flight.

12:14.000 --> 12:21.000
And we were in the middle of the night going up and I just became conscious of it all at about 5,000 feet.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
And that just terrified me.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
I would imagine saying that.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And did everything by road memory?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Apparently did everything right.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
We were at the back seat or what had gotten on me?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
You glad it only happened once.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
Speaking of back seat, I know in Vietnam you wanted to talk about a friend named Tom Burge.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Yes, Tom Burge.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I trained with at Davis Mountain.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
He was my assigned back seat.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
Now he was a young pilot right out of the pilot's school.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
But most of the back seaters in F4s at the time in Vietnam were pilots rather than radar observers.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
And so I flew most of my missions in Vietnam with Tom.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
And after I left I put in about two thirds of a tour at Cameron Bay.

13:06.000 --> 13:14.000
And then they reassigned me to Tonsonute to be in country briefing officer for General Brown, the commanding general.

13:14.000 --> 13:22.000
And I at the time at Cameron Bay was the flight commander and I reliquished my flight to my assistant flight commander.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Tom Burge was the best back seater in the flight.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
So he took over my back seat here.

13:28.000 --> 13:37.000
And they unfortunately were killed and I tried to catch on a nice grumble at night.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
So he didn't make it back.

13:39.000 --> 13:47.000
I often think about Tom and he was fine in men.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Well, I know you do and we salute his service also.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
You were talking about flying and sort of the thrills of flying.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
And I remember you were telling me about taking off in these fighters when they were full load and full heavy.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
And sort of a method of taking off that I'm somewhat unbelievable.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
But I'm going to let you tell the story.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
Well, normally every take off ever made an effort even loaded with weapons in Vietnam.

14:13.000 --> 14:21.000
The normal take was to take the stick and put it all the way back against the seat and hold it there.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
And put the power up full power and go into afterburn.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
And when you got to the nose wheel lift off speed, which is around 145, 150,

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
and those would just come up and would fly off just like a Pipercat.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
We had one mission when the case on battle.

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
The marine outpost at case on was pretty hot.

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
Where the North Vietnamese had put in a bunch of cannons, guns,

14:54.000 --> 15:01.000
on the reverse slope of a mountain northeast of the case on air strip.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
They were not only shooting across the top of the mountain at the air strip,

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
but they're also shooting using some for any aircraft shooting at aircraft.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
So they wanted to go up there with a maximum load they told us.

15:14.000 --> 15:24.000
And during the briefing they said, well, because you're going to have 12, 750 pound bombs loaded on this F4,

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
the center of gravity is going to be a little bit too far, far, and by the way,

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
it's over gross the airplane, but that's okay during combat, you don't bother with things like it.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
And they said the airplane won't take off.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
That's an issue.

15:39.000 --> 15:49.000
After we survived the shock, they said, what you have to do is leave the stick and neutral

15:49.000 --> 16:00.000
so that the stabilator or the elevator is in neutral and thus the least amount of drag.

16:00.000 --> 16:08.000
And when you get to 153 knots, take the stick and bang it against the importer of battle.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Back against the seat and hold it there.

16:12.000 --> 16:20.000
And what happens is that this puts the nose down and depresses the nose gear strut

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
and then it rebounds up to an angle of attack where you can take off and we took off.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
We sat there and said, mm, mentally, yes sir, we did all work.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
And we're getting it.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It's like they said that it was like it is.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
We're going to some photographs right now that Major Burns has supplied for us here.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
These are photographs that come from his home and I'm going to let him talk about them as they come on the screen.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I talk about this picture of what we're looking at.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Well, that was the airplane that I had in my name, not it, and Tom Burns.

16:50.000 --> 16:57.000
Unfortunately, the name was on the other side, but it just failed to get a picture of what our names are.

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
This was the armant crew and they had just finished arming the aircraft and to go on the mission

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
we had arrived out at the airplane ready to go on another mission.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Now, is that the Phantom 2?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
That is the F4 Phantom 2.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
F4 Phantom 2.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Okay.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Let's go on to the next photograph.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
There you are.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
That's a picture of me.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Pretty nice handlebar mustache.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Why does that have to be so nice there?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Nice butterfly mustache.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Funny story about that.

17:25.000 --> 17:35.000
I was quite a commander and just about everybody in the twelfth when you, I guess, in the hierarchy tolerated but didn't really like mustache on the pilots.

17:35.000 --> 17:44.000
And General Ryan, who I believe was the commander of Pac-Aff at the time, was visiting Cameron Bay in my squadron commander,

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
and he says, Burns, you go up the tower and you stay there the whole time the journal's up there.

17:49.000 --> 17:55.000
I knew exactly what he was talking about because General Ryan wasn't about to climb all those stairs up the top of the tower and seemed to be with a mustache.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
So I got away.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Indeed.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Okay. Let's move on.

18:00.000 --> 18:09.000
This is the picture that I had commissioned of a painter that paints aviation really in sight.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
And I told him about it and gave him some pictures of that forest of KC-135's.

18:16.000 --> 18:25.000
After we took off with that load of 12, 700 pound bombs, we didn't really have enough fuel to get up the case on.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
So we had to hit the tanker and get refueled on the way up there.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Right.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
And that's what that depicts.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Five, five, two in my airplanes.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
The one sitting up there on the wing waiting to get refueled.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Right.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Let's go into the next picture.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
You have a collection in your home.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Oh, that's my gun collection later on.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
But go ahead and tell us what we're looking at.

18:47.000 --> 18:54.000
Back in the 50s and 60s, I was quite active in gun collecting.

18:54.000 --> 19:07.000
And most of those guns used to be just in pawn shops and gun shops where I mostly bought them.

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
And people had them for bureau drawer guns and so forth.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
And they were very cheap.

19:15.000 --> 19:23.000
And in 1968, when they had the rights in California, virtually all guns.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
Handguns disappeared useful handguns.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
They disappeared from gun shops.

19:29.000 --> 19:36.000
And when they came back, they were all regarded as collectors items.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Yeah.

19:37.000 --> 19:44.000
But I had already put together a complete representative sample of all of the 38 ACP,

19:44.000 --> 19:51.000
38 caliber automatics that Cope made from 1900 to about 1928.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
That's quite a collection.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
A lot of veterans have shadow boxes.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
That's quite a shadow box of your own.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
A lot of those metals were shooting metals.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Right.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
That's an amazing thing that I got to see in your home.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
We've got one more picture of your family.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
That's my family.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
That's you and your wife.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
My wife and I and my son and daughter-in-law.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
My son is assistant district attorney in Dallas County.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
That's pretty.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
And I think 19 years, that's pretty.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
And your daughter-in-law.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
And a lot of Tracy.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
And you and Adam had an older son, Glenn, who unfortunately lost you.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Yeah.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
How are you, Alex?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
And an accident.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
But that's your family.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
That was taken just a few years ago.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
So, buying a looking family there.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
I want to go to live right here in our studio now.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
And you are a collector of models of the planes that you have flown.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
Show us a little bit what we're looking at right here.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Oh, just about area.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
And the air force has a model of airplanes and flew.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
This is the F-100.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
This one is the first one.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
That's the F-86 F-6.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
That's the one on the left as you're looking at the screen.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Go ahead and pull it back in there.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
There we go.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
And this was the next one, the F-100.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Now, for the purist to look at this,

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
you'll see that's an F-100D.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
I did fly some of the D, but most of my time was in the C model.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
And then after my training allied pilots,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
I went to F-4's transition.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I flew the C model.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
And this is the F-4.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
And I flew that in Vietnam.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
And the subsequent assignments to Europe.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
That one right there.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
The subsequent assignment to Europe.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
I flew the D model and the E model.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
And this one, I had an opportunity.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Well, I was at Thompsonute.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
And I had so many friends in the Vietnamese Air Force.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
And there were probably eight to ten people that I had trained

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
in the one jet squadron in Vietnam, 62 squadron.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
And they were flying the F-5 Freedom Fighter.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
And this is a model that has the Vietnamese markings on it.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
It's just the exact light flew.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
And they let me fly the airplane.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
I think they had 19 combat sorties with the V-9.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
That was a great fun.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Well, they're fascinating.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I had great regard for the Vietnamese pilots.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
I'm a fan of the models.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
And these are really, really stuff.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
After Vietnam, you actually took another tour of Europe of Germany.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
You went back to Europe.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
I had a concurrent tour back over to Europe.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
I liked Europe, and the family got to go both times.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
So I had two kids by the time I got over there.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
And they thrived on Europe.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Indeed.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
You came back to Texas A&M, and I know, and you taught there for seven or eight years.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
You finally retired from the Air Force after twenty-one years.

22:49.000 --> 22:55.000
I retired in 1973 after twenty years of flying.

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
I'm going to admit that my sole motivation in the Air Force was flying

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
and fighters if possible.

23:03.000 --> 23:10.000
And after twenty years of Air Force out of policy where all people who had been flying twenty years,

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
quote, unquote, didn't need to fly anymore.

23:14.000 --> 23:20.000
And so that was concurrent with my completion of my overseas tour.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
I just couldn't see coming back to the States, sitting at some desk and watching everybody fly.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
So I was able to retire twenty-one years and did.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
Came back to Texas A&M, worked in the executive development office and taught management for a while.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
I taught management for a couple of semesters, something like that.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
I had earned a master's degree from USC while I was in the Air Force.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
It was then qualified to teach it.

23:46.000 --> 23:55.000
And I stayed with A&M about eight years, I guess, and then my wife and I owned a health food store.

23:55.000 --> 24:01.000
And I helped besides that, I worked for you, I've worked for about three years, I've been saying to them.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
I don't know where I got the idea about during my career.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
I always had the idea in my mind that I would try, I'd like to retire at age 55.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
And we script and save and invested and were able to do it.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Well, I want to get it, we've only got about three minutes left.

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
And I want to talk about the A&M pistol team because you've been the coach of the pistol team for thirty years.

24:24.000 --> 24:32.000
During the 60s, I had to go out and qualify with the pistol every year.

24:32.000 --> 24:38.000
And it hurt my pride because of the pistol collection I had that I couldn't shoot the 45 well.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
So I got a guy that was on the pistol team at Randolph.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
And in my squadron, taught me how to shoot a 45.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Apparently showed him some talent and asked me to go on the pistol team.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
And so I was on the pistol team at Randolph for several years and on Davis, Monthon, several years.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
And I wasn't great, but I was almost.

24:59.000 --> 25:09.000
But anyway, I was good enough where after the Vietnam and the United States and Europe,

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
which was total about six years, came back and got us kind of over the hill.

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
And it's a more competing.

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
But I did volunteer and started coaching.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
Actually, I had to start up a team that had started up the pistol team in 1974.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
And I've been coaching it ever since.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
And I enjoy coaching every bit as much as I did competing.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
And it is really a lot of fun.

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
Two years ago, my, I coached both the university team and the ROTC pistol team.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
The ROTC pistol team won the National ROTC pistol championship.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
So I was quite proud of that.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
And finished second last year?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Is that right?

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Second last year.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
But it's a whole new year now.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
A whole new year?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
We're going to win it again.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
There's about a dozen on each team.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
I think you said on the university team and the ROTC team.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
And they compete against other schools.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
It's not a, well, it's a double-ac support for the students.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
For example, we go to the National Collegial Pistol Championships.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
They invite the top 10 teams in the nation.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
We've been in the top 10 teams in the nation.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
26, I know.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
24 out of the last 26 years that they've had the National Championships.

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
And we finished, the best we finished is third.

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
But I was quite proud of our ROTC team winning it.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
That was two years ago.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
That was two years ago.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
And I believe you're hosting at a match.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
We'll have a match at about three weeks.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Right.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
Nationals this year, instead of being in Fort Benning,

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
it's going to be at West Point.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
All of our team members are access to Goop and see West Point.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Well, we got them in football this past year.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
We'll get them in pistol also.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Thank you very much for your service.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
We're out of time and I appreciate it.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Thank you, sir.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Major Burns.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
The pilot and Vietnam Kurt Burns could hardly stand being in active.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
He flew four or five days a week.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
