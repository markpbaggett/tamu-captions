00:30.000 --> 00:39.240
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.560
I'm Tom Turbivill.

00:41.560 --> 00:46.280
Some call it the forgotten war, but Norman Beale of rural Brass' County has not forgotten

00:46.280 --> 00:52.880
a thing about his second battalion, Fifth Marine's assault on the Korean coast in 1950.

00:52.880 --> 00:57.560
Nor has he forgotten the horror and the cold of that winter, scaling the cliffs at the

00:57.560 --> 00:59.160
beaches at Inchan.

00:59.200 --> 01:03.880
The card game that he lost that kept him in Korea to fight even longer, the Korean

01:03.880 --> 01:08.760
war cost 54,000 American lives and another 8,000 were missing.

01:08.760 --> 01:13.360
Norman Beale counts himself very lucky to have survived to tell his story of service.

01:13.360 --> 01:17.120
Please welcome Norman Beale of Edge to Veterans of the Valley.

01:17.120 --> 01:21.880
Mr. Beale, it's not her to have you on Veterans of the Valley and thank you first for your service.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.600
You are a local kid all the way.

01:23.600 --> 01:30.400
You grew up in Brian, you graduated from Allen Academy in 1948 and want to move right

01:30.400 --> 01:36.120
along because you joined the Marine Corps soon after you graduated from high school in 1948.

01:36.120 --> 01:41.560
So take us from there and your service in the Marine Corps and how that got you overseas

01:41.560 --> 01:43.560
to Korea.

01:43.560 --> 01:51.960
Well, I was overseas in other places also for a couple of years and came back to the states

01:51.960 --> 01:58.280
and a few months later we had to turn around and go back.

01:58.280 --> 02:09.160
But we didn't in the Marine Corps at that time in 1948 only had about 75,000 Marines.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.160
Right.

02:10.160 --> 02:18.520
So they had to scrape all over the world and get more Marines to develop a brigade.

02:18.520 --> 02:29.640
One of my colleagues was calling for Marines early and all we could gather up was one brigade

02:29.640 --> 02:35.320
and each battalion was missing one company.

02:35.320 --> 02:41.480
And the company that we did have only had two cartoons.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.480
Right.

02:42.480 --> 02:43.480
So that was...

02:43.480 --> 02:44.480
Right.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.840
And the military had really changed because it was after World War II and the military

02:49.840 --> 02:52.440
was kind of scaling down at that time.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.440
Very much so.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.920
You talked about how the military had changed during this time between World War II and before

02:57.920 --> 02:59.440
the Korean War broke out.

02:59.440 --> 03:06.120
Now after World War II all future wars were going to be push buttons.

03:06.120 --> 03:12.640
And so the Air Force decided they didn't need too many Army personnel.

03:12.640 --> 03:20.400
They didn't need the Marines but the Navy, they wanted to keep the Navy.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.400
Right.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.400
Right.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.320
You had spent a long time on a boat.

03:25.320 --> 03:29.640
I know you'd gone out to the Mariana Islands and the West Pacific for your training and

03:29.640 --> 03:34.960
you came home, said you'd never get on a boat again but that was wrong because Korean war

03:34.960 --> 03:37.120
broke out and you were headed to Korea.

03:37.120 --> 03:41.840
I didn't want to get in on any more stinking shit.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.960
You talk highly about the training that you got because you said that a lot of the

03:45.960 --> 03:53.960
NCOs and the officers were World War II veterans who were certainly war experienced themselves.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.600
So you did get some good training from these folks.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.800
Yes and just the Marine Corps trains all the time.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.800
Right.

04:01.800 --> 04:08.160
I finally got back to the States and I got out of the Fleet Marine Force and was put

04:08.160 --> 04:14.440
in a company that didn't go in the field.

04:14.440 --> 04:22.000
So our new colonel decided we were getting soft and after I was there about three weeks

04:22.000 --> 04:24.160
we were putting the field again.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.160
Right.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.840
I learned how to dig foxholes again.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.240
And you would need that later on.

04:29.240 --> 04:34.320
Obviously, second battalion, fifth Marines, this is one of the oldest outfits dating back

04:34.320 --> 04:35.920
to World War I.

04:35.920 --> 04:40.240
As a matter of fact, I looked up it was a German soldiers that actually gave them the nickname

04:40.240 --> 04:44.920
the devil dogs because they were so tough fighting in World War I in 1918.

04:44.920 --> 04:45.920
Bellowwood.

04:45.920 --> 04:46.920
That's right.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.920
That's right.

04:47.920 --> 04:51.640
So this was part of the outfit that you were in.

04:51.640 --> 04:58.800
You left San Diego, August of 1950 and thought you were going to stop over in Japan but you

04:58.800 --> 05:02.240
went straight to the coast of Korea to Busan.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.240
Talk about that.

05:03.240 --> 05:07.760
It wasn't much of South Korea left.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.320
That's why we didn't stop.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.320
Right.

05:10.320 --> 05:17.280
And when we got to Busan, Korea, our general was down on the dock.

05:17.280 --> 05:23.160
He wanted to know if Colonel Murray had gotten his message.

05:23.160 --> 05:28.400
And Murray called out and said, no sir.

05:28.400 --> 05:35.240
And he said, well, you get off the ship now and let's move on to the front.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.240
Right.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.880
And that was his message that we didn't get.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.880
Right.

05:39.880 --> 05:48.680
But fortunately, we spent that whole night unloading the ship and early the next morning we

05:48.680 --> 05:51.080
moved forward.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.760
So you didn't stick around long.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.120
You were headed to the front.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.120
Right.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.720
And talk about that.

05:56.720 --> 06:01.720
Talk about your first venture into combat heading towards North Korea.

06:01.720 --> 06:02.720
What you recall about that.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.880
Because you're still a young kid.

06:03.880 --> 06:10.960
I mean, you're a young kid from the country and it's quite a change in your life, obviously.

06:10.960 --> 06:18.440
We were down in South Korea and like I say, we were pushed into combat right away on August

06:18.440 --> 06:20.960
the 7th.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.040
We attacked.

06:23.040 --> 06:28.640
And that was the same date that the offensive action in World War II.

06:28.640 --> 06:35.040
August the 7th of the Gwata Canal, the first Marine vision, which the 5th Marines was

06:35.040 --> 06:37.040
part of.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.040
Right.

06:38.040 --> 06:46.440
And after a couple of few days, we had pushed the North Koreans back 30 miles, 30 plus

06:46.440 --> 06:47.440
miles.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.240
Right.

06:48.240 --> 06:53.120
And the very next day or two, we were called back down South.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.960
They could not protect our sides.

06:56.960 --> 07:03.560
And then we put what we call the fire brigade.

07:03.560 --> 07:08.760
We moved from one spot to another, trying to hold the North Koreans back.

07:08.760 --> 07:09.760
Right.

07:09.760 --> 07:14.960
We had two major battles on the NACTON River.

07:14.960 --> 07:21.320
The first NACTON, we pushed them back over the river and we all went down and rested

07:21.320 --> 07:24.200
two days or three days.

07:24.200 --> 07:34.240
And we were called back up because we had lost or the military had lost the NACTON front

07:34.240 --> 07:35.240
again.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.440
It was called the NACTON Bulls.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
Right.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.880
The 6th North Korean People's Army.

07:40.880 --> 07:41.880
Right.

07:41.880 --> 07:48.780
The first of his day they had come from Seoul, the capital all the way down to this little

07:48.780 --> 07:50.920
area down in Busan.

07:50.920 --> 07:54.160
We call it the Busan perimeter.

07:54.160 --> 08:01.720
And they had not hit anything, but they found a new breed of cat down there.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.720
Right.

08:02.720 --> 08:03.720
And so.

08:03.720 --> 08:04.720
Go ahead.

08:04.720 --> 08:14.440
Then we were pulled off the NACTON and all of a sudden we went down to Seoul, Busan.

08:14.440 --> 08:21.080
And we got on board ship and we thought maybe we could get to go back to Japan for our

08:21.080 --> 08:22.080
and our duty.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.520
Because you done such a good job.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.800
Because we had done such a good job.

08:25.800 --> 08:30.800
But I looked at one morning and there were ships and there were directions.

08:30.800 --> 08:37.880
And then they come on the intercom and they told us that we had been selected to hit the

08:37.880 --> 08:41.160
North Koreans right in the throat.

08:41.160 --> 08:46.240
We were going to make an in-chon landing at Seoul.

08:46.240 --> 08:50.560
Seoul was about 30 something miles from In-chon.

08:50.560 --> 08:51.560
Right.

08:51.560 --> 09:00.760
But when we got to In-chon, all of the Navy were bombarding in-chon for people.

09:00.760 --> 09:07.660
And our planes were coming over and strafing and bombing and didn't see how anybody could

09:07.660 --> 09:08.660
live.

09:08.660 --> 09:19.320
But anyway, one of our battagons had to take a small island right out from In-chon.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.240
It had a causeway going in to In-chon.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.240
Right.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.240
Right.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.240
This was Womito Island.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.240
Is that right?

09:26.240 --> 09:27.240
Is that what you told me?

09:27.240 --> 09:29.080
I believe that's what you told me the other day.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.080
Womito.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.080
There we go.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.080
I was close.

09:32.080 --> 09:36.080
It had a causeway actually from the island to the mainland.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.080
Yes, to the mainland.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.080
Right.

09:39.080 --> 09:46.320
And the third battalion had to set up on that highway and keep from attacking on the way.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.320
But the island was armed with North Koreans.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
Yes, yes.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.320
Right.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.560
And we pretty well wiped them out.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.160
Our third battalion pretty well wiped them all out.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.160
Right.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.160
And we were witnessing this.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.560
Were you still on the boat or had you?

09:59.560 --> 10:00.560
I was still on the boat.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.160
You were still on the ship?

10:02.160 --> 10:03.160
Yes.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.160
Two.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.160
We had two battalion still.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.960
We had got our third battalion, finally.

10:08.960 --> 10:09.960
Right.

10:09.960 --> 10:10.960
And we were on board.

10:10.960 --> 10:24.380
Now the reason we were on board in Korea, they had one of the highest water up 30, the

10:24.380 --> 10:26.980
tide of 30 feet.

10:26.980 --> 10:29.380
And then it would drop.

10:29.380 --> 10:33.820
And after it dropped, there was just a huge mud flat out there.

10:33.820 --> 10:35.620
And our ships were in the mud.

10:35.620 --> 10:36.620
Right.

10:36.620 --> 10:38.700
Still shooting.

10:38.700 --> 10:43.740
So we had ladders that the Navy had fixed for us.

10:43.740 --> 10:47.420
And we crawled up a seawall.

10:47.420 --> 10:54.100
And when we got off the seawall, my own gunnery sergeant was walking up and down.

10:54.100 --> 11:02.260
And as you know, a gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps has used his words that I wouldn't

11:02.260 --> 11:04.740
repeat right now.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.300
That's why he's a gunnery sergeant.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.300
That's right.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.300
Get off the beach.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.300
Get off the beach.

11:09.300 --> 11:14.500
And we captured our in-chon pretty quick.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.500
Excuse me.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.500
I can get mixed up.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.500
Right.

11:17.500 --> 11:22.140
And as soon as we did do, we started for so.

11:22.140 --> 11:26.260
Now you're all, I want the viewers to be able to picture this.

11:26.260 --> 11:27.260
You're on foot.

11:27.260 --> 11:28.260
Yes.

11:28.260 --> 11:29.260
Right.

11:29.260 --> 11:32.460
What kind of weaponry did you personally have?

11:32.460 --> 11:35.260
I started out with the machine gun.

11:35.260 --> 11:42.380
And been later on, I got the car being and I got rid of it as soon as I couldn't, got

11:42.380 --> 11:44.700
an M1 rifle.

11:44.700 --> 11:45.700
Right.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.540
And the very good rifle.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.540
Right.

11:48.540 --> 11:49.540
Oh yeah.

11:49.540 --> 11:52.060
I know.

11:52.060 --> 11:54.140
So you're marching and you're battling?

11:54.140 --> 11:56.060
Well, we're battling.

11:56.060 --> 11:58.780
And because this is what the war was all about.

11:58.780 --> 11:59.780
That's what we got.

11:59.780 --> 12:08.940
We captured Kimpo Airfield, which was one of any tarmacs there other than few knockdown

12:08.940 --> 12:10.780
yaks.

12:10.780 --> 12:17.620
And we made another landing after we captured the air base.

12:17.620 --> 12:26.780
We crossed the Han River in LCVP's landing craft.

12:26.780 --> 12:32.900
We made it across and then we headed to Seoul.

12:32.900 --> 12:39.380
My battalion did not go down our regiment, did not go down into the city of Seoul.

12:39.380 --> 12:43.460
That was the first regiment with Chester Pillar and his group.

12:43.460 --> 12:44.460
Right.

12:44.460 --> 12:47.820
And Chester Pillar, he was the most decorated soldier of the Korean War.

12:47.820 --> 12:49.820
He was most decorated Marine.

12:49.820 --> 12:50.820
Marine, excuse me, yes.

12:50.820 --> 13:00.580
Of the Korean War, of Wars, he was fought in the Banana Wars and all the way up.

13:00.580 --> 13:01.820
That was a good outfit.

13:01.820 --> 13:02.820
Right.

13:02.820 --> 13:08.220
He was one who said, we've got the enemy in front of us and we've got him in back of us.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.980
And we've got him on each side.

13:09.980 --> 13:14.260
We've got him right where we won't, he can't get away now.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.260
And he was about right.

13:16.260 --> 13:24.660
I know that you're reluctant to talk specifically about, as you refer to, the blood and guts

13:24.660 --> 13:25.660
of war.

13:25.660 --> 13:27.300
And I understand that.

13:27.300 --> 13:33.020
But what were your thoughts about what you were seeing?

13:33.020 --> 13:34.340
Were you frightened?

13:34.340 --> 13:40.620
Did your training kick in when it needed to?

13:40.620 --> 13:43.820
What were your thoughts about life and death at that time that you recall?

13:43.820 --> 13:52.580
Well, if you're in combat, you're afraid until you go into the attack or until the enemy

13:52.580 --> 13:54.220
goes into an attack.

13:54.220 --> 13:59.420
So then you get fairly calm.

13:59.420 --> 14:04.740
We had some horrible battles down in the perimeter, Pusan perimeter.

14:04.740 --> 14:05.740
Right.

14:05.740 --> 14:12.020
But when we got on board ship, we went up, Tenchon, captured the capital.

14:12.020 --> 14:19.220
So we went back down, got on board ship, surely it's our own arduous.

14:19.220 --> 14:26.260
But we went all the way around the peninsula of Korea to the east side of North Korea.

14:26.260 --> 14:27.260
Right.

14:27.260 --> 14:29.220
The place called Wonson.

14:29.220 --> 14:38.260
It was more of an administrative movement into the city of Wonson.

14:38.260 --> 14:39.260
Right.

14:39.260 --> 14:49.020
And then a day or two later we got on board train, flat cars starting to get in cold.

14:49.020 --> 14:51.340
And we headed north.

14:51.340 --> 14:57.620
One of the things that really had us worried, we went to a long, long tunnel.

14:57.620 --> 15:04.740
And fortunately the North Koreans were not thinking about that tunnel.

15:04.740 --> 15:09.500
We went on up to Haggaroo, North Korea.

15:09.500 --> 15:18.700
And then we headed north, headed for the Chosin reservoir area.

15:18.700 --> 15:25.380
And just before we got to the mountains, we had mountains on top of mountains.

15:25.380 --> 15:37.420
We got on board a very small, small, cow track going up into North Korea, up into the

15:37.420 --> 15:38.900
reservoir area.

15:38.900 --> 15:39.900
Yes, sir.

15:39.900 --> 15:46.540
When we got up there, I think I have heard, I don't know if anybody that had a thermometer.

15:46.540 --> 15:53.420
But I heard that when we got to the top it was 13, over 13 degrees below zero.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.300
And that was a physiological shock.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.300
All that.

15:57.300 --> 16:01.500
And thank goodness no one attacked that night.

16:01.500 --> 16:08.180
Stayed there a few days and then the seventh regiment and the fifth regiment moved up

16:08.180 --> 16:16.420
to Haggaroo, North Korea, which was right at the bottom of the big reservoir.

16:16.420 --> 16:24.020
Our regiment went up the right side, or the east side, and the there too.

16:24.020 --> 16:27.820
We had thanks even.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.420
And it kind of warmed up.

16:30.420 --> 16:34.940
But we were only there just three or four days.

16:34.940 --> 16:45.900
And we started down because two regiment, our partial regiment, of the seventh Army division

16:46.300 --> 16:51.180
came up to the right side and took our place.

16:51.180 --> 16:54.340
They were pretty well slaughtered later.

16:54.340 --> 16:57.900
I think our 800 got out.

16:57.900 --> 16:58.900
Right.

16:58.900 --> 17:04.380
Let's pause right there and let's look at some photographs of some of the things we're

17:04.380 --> 17:08.180
talking about because you have mentioned how cold it became.

17:08.180 --> 17:13.180
And we've got some photographs that depict 30 and 40 below.

17:13.180 --> 17:14.180
Right.

17:14.180 --> 17:17.980
And some pictures first off, this is you and your older brothers.

17:17.980 --> 17:19.940
You're the baby of the family, you're on the left.

17:19.940 --> 17:20.940
That's correct.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.740
And these are your brothers.

17:22.740 --> 17:23.740
Right.

17:23.740 --> 17:27.860
Who were they from, say from right to left as we're looking at it?

17:27.860 --> 17:29.820
Right to left, left, left, deal.

17:29.820 --> 17:30.820
Yes sir.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.820
My brother, right, he was next to me.

17:32.820 --> 17:33.820
Oh next to you, okay.

17:33.820 --> 17:38.620
And the oldest one was Jacob deal in the middle there.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.220
And over and deal.

17:40.220 --> 17:43.460
So orange is on the right as we're looking at the picture here.

17:43.460 --> 17:44.460
Oh I'm sorry.

17:44.460 --> 17:45.460
That's okay.

17:45.460 --> 17:46.460
That's starting over here.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.460
That's fine, I understand.

17:48.460 --> 17:49.460
Okay.

17:49.460 --> 17:52.340
I think the next picture we have is you as a young Marine.

17:52.340 --> 17:53.340
There you are.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.940
Was that when you just joined up?

17:55.940 --> 17:57.940
And just got out of boot camp.

17:57.940 --> 18:00.020
Just got out of boot camp.

18:00.020 --> 18:01.420
You got me dress blues.

18:01.420 --> 18:02.420
Good looking.

18:02.420 --> 18:08.460
I found this photograph depicting the landing at Enchon and the type of ladders.

18:08.460 --> 18:11.100
This probably looks somewhat familiar to you.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.420
Very, very much so.

18:12.420 --> 18:16.260
The guy right up at the top was a lieutenant.

18:16.260 --> 18:24.400
And he was killed five or six yards later because when he was getting his men off the

18:24.400 --> 18:33.060
boat and somebody threw a grenade in this guy, he did not fight down in the south.

18:33.060 --> 18:35.660
This was his first combat.

18:35.660 --> 18:39.980
And he covered that grenade saving the men on each side.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.980
He got the medal of honor.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.700
I wish I could remember his name, but I can't.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.700
Okay, let's move on.

18:47.700 --> 18:54.340
This is a photograph that certainly depicts the cold, the snow, the cold.

18:54.340 --> 18:56.980
Just trying to get some sleep, trying to get some rest, right?

18:56.980 --> 18:59.060
Actually we were on the road.

18:59.060 --> 19:00.860
We were surrounding.

19:00.860 --> 19:05.140
We were cut off up at a place called Yudamni.

19:05.140 --> 19:09.220
And Hangeru was cut off on both sides by the North Koreans.

19:09.220 --> 19:13.140
Or you have to buy the Chinese.

19:13.140 --> 19:21.020
There's 120,000 Chinese that came in with strict orders to do away with the Marines.

19:21.020 --> 19:22.020
Right.

19:22.020 --> 19:30.900
Because they were killers, murderers, rapists, thieves.

19:30.900 --> 19:33.260
So they tried.

19:33.260 --> 19:43.540
We were able to severely knock out seven infrared visions of the Chinese.

19:43.540 --> 19:48.580
And they had a few more that got out.

19:48.580 --> 19:49.580
Right.

19:49.580 --> 19:50.580
There's some more photographs.

19:50.580 --> 19:53.340
You talked about this photograph, you're in the middle.

19:53.340 --> 19:58.980
That's, yeah, I was at that Aircrew 30 machine gun right at first.

19:58.980 --> 19:59.980
Right.

19:59.980 --> 20:02.300
And two buddies there with me.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.260
The one on the right was Texan.

20:05.260 --> 20:06.260
Yes, sir.

20:06.260 --> 20:08.260
And he's dead today.

20:08.260 --> 20:10.860
And you're the one in the middle without the helmet.

20:10.860 --> 20:11.860
Right.

20:11.860 --> 20:12.860
Right.

20:12.860 --> 20:13.860
Right.

20:13.860 --> 20:15.660
This wasn't during the cold part, obviously.

20:15.660 --> 20:16.660
No.

20:16.660 --> 20:17.660
No short sleeves.

20:17.660 --> 20:19.140
Very, very humid.

20:19.140 --> 20:20.140
Right.

20:20.140 --> 20:21.940
And get up to around 113.

20:21.940 --> 20:22.940
Right.

20:22.940 --> 20:25.940
And we didn't have enough water.

20:25.940 --> 20:26.940
Right.

20:26.940 --> 20:27.940
Okay.

20:28.580 --> 20:32.780
This is another one of David Douglas Duncan's photographs.

20:32.780 --> 20:36.660
And I believe these are not Marines here.

20:36.660 --> 20:38.660
There's some Marines in the ditch there.

20:38.660 --> 20:40.660
Yes, sir.

20:40.660 --> 20:45.460
But he didn't like that photograph, but yeah, it was used on a stamp.

20:45.460 --> 20:46.460
Right.

20:46.460 --> 20:47.460
Right.

20:47.460 --> 20:48.460
That's that picture.

20:48.460 --> 20:49.780
Incredible photograph.

20:49.780 --> 20:52.580
There you are.

20:52.580 --> 20:57.460
As you were fixing to be able to come home.

20:57.460 --> 20:58.460
Right.

20:58.460 --> 21:01.780
You've grown yourself a little pretty good looking stash there.

21:01.780 --> 21:02.780
Right.

21:02.780 --> 21:04.660
I don't know how I got away with it.

21:04.660 --> 21:06.580
Bring the court and put it up with that.

21:06.580 --> 21:11.620
But you told the story about that if you wanted to go R and R to Japan, you had to get

21:11.620 --> 21:14.660
that shaved off and you were the first to get your shaved off.

21:14.660 --> 21:15.660
It came off immediately.

21:15.660 --> 21:17.860
Yeah, I bet it did.

21:17.860 --> 21:23.020
I was standing right next to one of my men on board shift.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.780
And I was making comments.

21:25.780 --> 21:30.860
He turned around and looked at me and he said, Bill, is that you?

21:30.860 --> 21:32.360
Without the beard.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.380
Move on to the next.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.860
This is a...

21:36.860 --> 21:37.860
Those are prisoners.

21:37.860 --> 21:38.860
Yeah.

21:38.860 --> 21:45.780
This is a newspaper that comes out, this was spring of 84 called the Chosen Few of this

21:45.780 --> 21:51.020
sort of a publication that is about your unit.

21:51.020 --> 21:53.260
You know what I'm going to add there.

21:53.260 --> 21:54.260
Excuse me.

21:54.260 --> 21:56.500
I'm going to talk to a torture today.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.500
Yes, sir.

21:58.500 --> 22:03.660
We got the word that you do not mistreat any, any misogyr.

22:03.660 --> 22:06.060
We want them to come out with our hands up.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.060
Yes, sir.

22:07.060 --> 22:10.180
Not too many of them did, but some of them did.

22:10.180 --> 22:11.180
Right.

22:11.180 --> 22:13.180
Move on to...

22:13.180 --> 22:15.220
Now tell me, this is you on the right.

22:15.220 --> 22:19.980
Tell me about the person on the left and this is a person that you actually...

22:19.980 --> 22:20.980
This is me.

22:20.980 --> 22:21.980
So it's out of a foxhole, right?

22:21.980 --> 22:22.980
Right.

22:22.980 --> 22:23.980
Is this Mr. Dixon?

22:23.980 --> 22:24.980
Yes, sir.

22:24.980 --> 22:27.220
And he was...

22:27.220 --> 22:30.060
He was my buddy after we met there.

22:30.060 --> 22:31.460
I didn't know who he was.

22:31.460 --> 22:32.460
Right.

22:32.460 --> 22:38.460
He had both legs blown off and he came up to me and put his arm around in Hugmanek.

22:38.460 --> 22:40.460
This was out of a reunion, right?

22:40.460 --> 22:41.460
Right.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.460
He...

22:42.460 --> 22:43.460
Right.

22:43.460 --> 22:48.060
And I don't know where the even new foot outfitties in because we had replacements coming

22:48.060 --> 22:52.500
in all the time.

22:52.500 --> 22:57.140
And you had drug him out of a foxhole and this is the first time that you all have seen

22:57.140 --> 22:59.140
each other since then in 1950.

22:59.140 --> 23:00.140
Right.

23:00.140 --> 23:01.140
So quite a...

23:01.140 --> 23:02.940
Since 1950, right.

23:02.940 --> 23:03.940
He...

23:03.940 --> 23:13.980
He was in that foxhole and there were others wounded and some killed in a martyr attack.

23:13.980 --> 23:20.380
That day we had gone through a small, small village and I got the honor to be sent back to

23:20.380 --> 23:25.380
that village to kick indoors to make sure everybody was out.

23:25.380 --> 23:26.380
Right.

23:26.380 --> 23:33.140
And I think about these guys over in Afghanistan and Iraq that have to kick in those doors

23:33.140 --> 23:35.900
and the chills on up and down my back.

23:35.900 --> 23:36.900
Indeed.

23:36.900 --> 23:43.180
Want to move along because we're running short on time.

23:43.180 --> 23:49.380
You had talked about fighting the Chinese because the North Koreans were pretty much punched

23:49.380 --> 23:53.700
out about this time and fighting the Chinese.

23:53.700 --> 23:58.420
And one thing that you credit really for saving your life during one battle is the World

23:58.420 --> 24:04.660
War II Corsairs and how they provided cover for you in one of the battles in North Korea.

24:04.660 --> 24:12.780
Well, the Marine Corps has an air ground team and on the ground we had flowers that were

24:12.780 --> 24:19.620
farer to observers because they knew how to talk to them in up in these Corsairs.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.020
These were World War II.

24:21.020 --> 24:27.820
It's like everything we had was World War II equipment except later on we had one of

24:27.820 --> 24:32.700
these bubbled helicopters that you see in mash.

24:32.700 --> 24:33.700
Right.

24:33.700 --> 24:34.700
Exactly.

24:34.700 --> 24:39.580
They had put Marines on both wounded on both sides and take them back as fast as they

24:39.580 --> 24:41.220
couldn't and come back.

24:41.220 --> 24:42.220
Right.

24:42.380 --> 24:48.020
You talked about going back, getting on shifts and how those ships had restuffed with

24:48.020 --> 24:53.180
some of what you estimated about 100,000 North Koreans that you took.

24:53.180 --> 24:54.180
Oh, yeah.

24:54.180 --> 24:55.180
Yeah.

24:55.180 --> 25:00.500
That you went to South Korea with you and that the first thing you did when you got back

25:00.500 --> 25:02.820
on the ship was fighting lifeboat to sleep.

25:02.820 --> 25:04.620
You were hungry but sleep was more important.

25:04.620 --> 25:05.620
Right.

25:05.620 --> 25:06.620
I crawled under a lifeboat.

25:06.620 --> 25:10.180
I didn't even go around in that stinking ship.

25:10.180 --> 25:12.660
We found out about this time that you were a corporal.

25:12.660 --> 25:16.820
There was another corporal and only one corporal could go back home and it was you.

25:16.820 --> 25:20.500
The other corporal was a young man with a fellow from Houston.

25:20.500 --> 25:24.660
And they said decide between yourselves which one goes home and which one stays and how

25:24.660 --> 25:25.660
did you do that?

25:25.660 --> 25:27.220
We drew cards.

25:27.220 --> 25:28.220
Somebody had some cards.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.260
I don't know where they came from.

25:30.260 --> 25:31.260
Right.

25:31.260 --> 25:37.900
But I drew a six and a McMahon drew a six.

25:37.900 --> 25:38.900
Right.

25:38.900 --> 25:40.820
And so we had to draw again.

25:40.820 --> 25:47.780
I drew a tin and he drew a jack and he got to go.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.820
And you got to stay and you thought that was in to me.

25:50.820 --> 25:52.660
I would not get out of there.

25:52.660 --> 25:53.660
Right.

25:53.660 --> 25:56.780
But I did about a month later.

25:56.780 --> 25:57.980
I got out.

25:57.980 --> 26:00.100
You got out about a month later.

26:00.100 --> 26:05.300
And so in all your service in Korea was it about eight months, right?

26:05.300 --> 26:06.300
That's right.

26:06.380 --> 26:12.420
I mean, people, they were pulled out first because they had been in constant battle.

26:12.420 --> 26:13.420
Right.

26:13.420 --> 26:19.940
The Korean War was an intense war as you can see from the number of people killed.

26:19.940 --> 26:20.940
Yeah.

26:20.940 --> 26:26.260
You were talking, matter of fact, you brought some numbers there from the chosen reservoir,

26:26.260 --> 26:28.180
the number of killed just from that.

26:28.180 --> 26:29.180
Right.

26:29.660 --> 26:36.060
It was approximately 15,000, 1000 of us up in the reservoir area.

26:36.060 --> 26:41.660
Plus some army that went on the east side of the reservoir.

26:41.660 --> 26:48.500
The 7th regiment and the 5th regiment were sent on up to a place called UDamn-E.

26:48.500 --> 26:52.140
We call it UDamn-E, or didn't get out.

26:52.140 --> 26:57.940
Because the pilots were flying over and they were taking beds.

26:57.940 --> 27:04.260
There's no way that the first marine division was going to get out of that area.

27:04.260 --> 27:05.260
Right.

27:05.260 --> 27:08.660
Got some figures here.

27:08.660 --> 27:14.260
Of course, I mentioned the coal wall ago and the coal would have got as you went out.

27:14.260 --> 27:15.260
Yes, sir.

27:15.260 --> 27:24.580
Approximately seven enemy divisions were wiped out or defeated severely by the first marine

27:24.580 --> 27:27.060
division.

27:27.060 --> 27:29.220
And let me see.

27:29.220 --> 27:37.780
Historians have termed the chosen reservoir campaign, the most savage battle of modern warfare.

27:37.780 --> 27:47.140
President Reagan, cited the chosen campaign, the epic military history.

27:47.140 --> 27:49.820
And so...

27:49.820 --> 27:53.980
No wonder you were such a proud group and a proud organization.

27:53.980 --> 27:54.980
That's correct.

27:54.980 --> 28:01.340
I wish we had time to talk more, but it was such a fantastic service and you are fortunate

28:01.340 --> 28:02.340
to be here.

28:02.340 --> 28:03.340
I got it.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.340
To tell the story.

28:04.340 --> 28:05.340
I got it.

28:05.340 --> 28:06.340
Yes, sir.

28:06.340 --> 28:07.340
A lot of combat.

28:07.340 --> 28:08.340
Thank you very much for your service.

28:08.340 --> 28:09.340
Sure.

28:09.340 --> 28:10.340
And thank you for your time.

28:10.340 --> 28:14.940
Norman Biel and his wife Wanda live in the country with a couple of very friendly dogs.

28:14.940 --> 28:19.780
Norman enjoys his life now that he has well earned by putting his life on the line for

28:19.780 --> 28:24.500
eight months of battling the North Koreans and the Chinese in what they called a forgotten

28:24.500 --> 28:26.100
war, Korea.

28:26.100 --> 28:28.860
But not forgotten to him and certainly not to us.

28:28.860 --> 28:32.500
We salute Norman Biel for his service as we do all veterans.

28:32.500 --> 28:33.980
I'm Tom Turbiewil.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.740
Please join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
