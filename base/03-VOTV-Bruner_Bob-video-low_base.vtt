00:46.700 --> 00:52.880
Welcome to Veteran to the Valley. I'm Tom Turbivill. Four months may not seem like

00:52.880 --> 00:57.460
the long time to most of us but for Bob Bruner of the first squadron, Fourth Cavalry,

00:57.460 --> 01:02.320
US Army, the four months starting on New Year's Day of 1991 was a period in

01:02.320 --> 01:06.740
time he'll never forget. Bob Bruner drove a Humvee in Operation Desert Storm's

01:06.740 --> 01:12.820
Ground War and he saw the war up close from start indeed to finish. It was his

01:12.820 --> 01:16.460
unit that took the airfield, it's soft one Iraq where the ceasefire was

01:16.460 --> 01:20.740
negotiated. It's a remarkable story of service and we welcome Sergeant Bob Bruner

01:20.740 --> 01:25.740
to Veteran to the Valley. Bob it is indeed a pleasure to have you here. I want

01:25.740 --> 01:31.400
to get you right to the Gulf War. New Year's Day 1991 you actually celebrated

01:31.400 --> 01:35.500
the New Year when midnight you were flying to Saudi Arabia from Brussels and I

01:35.500 --> 01:38.980
think you said the plane was over Ireland at the time right? Yeah the the

01:38.980 --> 01:42.820
pilot of the plane we flew over on and there were a lot of civilian pilots flew

01:42.820 --> 01:47.080
over volunteer force told us that if we looked over the right wing we'd see the

01:47.080 --> 01:50.160
lights of Ireland and if there was any place in the world we'd rather be that

01:50.160 --> 01:53.920
would be a good place to be right now and I would have to agree with that. Indeed

01:53.920 --> 01:58.960
but you landed at King Fod field in Saudi Arabia and the first thing that you

01:58.960 --> 02:02.760
remember you got out you'd been you'd come from a cold area it was mighty hot

02:02.760 --> 02:06.560
in Saudi Arabia as one can imagine. Yeah we flew out of a four-shield Pika

02:06.560 --> 02:11.660
Kansas and there was a blizzard going on and when we landed in King Fod

02:11.660 --> 02:17.740
field in Saudi Arabia just outside of Dahran it was all probably 80 90

02:17.740 --> 02:22.660
degrees and we had full full winter clothing on at that time and looking for a

02:22.660 --> 02:26.300
place to get out of it. You bust a place called Kobar Tower which you call the

02:26.300 --> 02:30.400
MGM Grand it was kind of a high-rise condo complex with no furniture but it

02:30.400 --> 02:34.140
was a place to sleep and sort of get over the jet lag. Talk about what what

02:34.140 --> 02:38.540
happened after that after you left Kobar towers and sort of take us from there

02:38.540 --> 02:45.300
into the start of the war. We left Kobar towers after our vehicles all arrived

02:45.300 --> 02:50.660
and moved took a very long convoy up to northern Saudi Arabia it was a very

02:50.660 --> 02:56.220
very long convoy it took all day and and went up through the early evening. About 13

02:56.220 --> 03:00.380
hours I think you said. About 13 hours yes we pulled and kind of circled our

03:00.380 --> 03:03.740
our vehicles kind of like the old cavities do circling the wagons we kind of

03:03.740 --> 03:08.400
circled the vehicles around cut some cut some shut-eye. We set up the

03:08.400 --> 03:11.900
forward area for the Cavalry first one and fourth Cavalry was the

03:11.900 --> 03:17.420
called TA Roosevelt which is a tactical assembly area and that's where we

03:17.420 --> 03:22.100
started getting off our equipment and ourselves ready in case what did

03:22.100 --> 03:26.780
happen pursued and of course the war started. Now you talked about the vehicles

03:26.780 --> 03:31.580
that showed up let's let's go back to the states these are vehicles that you

03:31.580 --> 03:35.660
had actually had a part in preparing to come over as far as painting camouflage

03:35.660 --> 03:40.340
things like that. All of our vehicles were painted in a a woodland camouflage the

03:40.340 --> 03:45.220
green and the black and the tan and of course that was set up for European

03:45.220 --> 03:50.740
theater and we went from and one weekend drove the whole squadron down to a

03:50.740 --> 03:55.180
paint shop kind of like I told you like an Earl Shies paint shop and you had to

03:55.180 --> 03:58.420
put grease and tape on the windows where they painted over it we had our desert

03:58.420 --> 04:02.500
chemo painted in our vehicles and then they rail headed from Fort Riley

04:02.500 --> 04:07.720
Kansas down to Port Arthur, Texas where they were put on on transports and

04:07.720 --> 04:12.420
shipped overseas. It was an idea of Saudi Arabia and sort of what it was like you

04:12.420 --> 04:18.960
lots of sand to deal with this as one would imagine. Lots of sand and it was the

04:18.960 --> 04:24.360
flattest place I've ever seen in my life even worse than Kansas and the sand

04:24.400 --> 04:29.260
air was really powdered almost like a nestle quick you know type of powder very

04:29.260 --> 04:34.960
very fine powdered sand with about about a foot or any that solid rock and very

04:34.960 --> 04:39.360
hard to dig foxholes and fighting positions and things like that. Right right and

04:39.360 --> 04:42.520
you had to protect yourself from the sand so you needed sort of unique

04:42.520 --> 04:46.960
equipment for that. Yeah we got to realize the sand was so fine we had we had no

04:46.960 --> 04:51.120
notice and usually when you have people over there you'll hear how things are

04:51.120 --> 04:55.840
but we got over there and we found out well our weapons were getting very very

04:55.840 --> 05:01.920
dirty very quick but it's very fine powdered sand so we requested pantyhose and

05:01.920 --> 05:07.560
plastic bags and items that we're going to protect our our weapons especially the

05:07.560 --> 05:10.920
pantyhose were just they worked amazing in keeping the dust and the sand

05:10.920 --> 05:15.960
off the bolts and the magazine covers and so on so forth. Right not just weapons

05:15.960 --> 05:20.400
but any type of electronics and anything it would protect. I had a yeah all the

05:20.400 --> 05:23.660
you know the plastic bags were really good for the tape recorder tape

05:23.660 --> 05:26.280
quarters are pretty popular over there because we set tapes back to our

05:26.280 --> 05:32.800
families. Right right take us on a little bit closer to when the air

05:32.800 --> 05:37.520
war started which a lot of people can recall that date sort of where they were

05:37.520 --> 05:42.760
in January 15th 1991 but before that you talked to me about a berm and in a

05:42.760 --> 05:48.160
flat land a berm obviously stands out. Yeah very very like I said very very

05:48.160 --> 05:53.320
flat terrain there and we it was getting closer to the deadline and so we

05:53.320 --> 05:57.360
moved further north we moved up to the neutral zone which Iraq when they went

05:57.360 --> 06:01.280
into Kuwait the neutral zone is the diamond triangle shape part of the

06:01.280 --> 06:09.040
country that's in between Saudi Arabia Kuwait and Iraq and the Iraqi army

06:09.040 --> 06:14.880
had went ahead and occupied the neutral zone and the engineers had one up to

06:14.880 --> 06:20.760
keep them from coming in further put up a humongous wall 12 15 foot tall wall of

06:20.760 --> 06:27.000
dirt and sand and rock and and probably about 12 12 15 foot wide I'd deep I

06:27.000 --> 06:33.240
would say and we were there for the for the first start of it and of course then

06:33.240 --> 06:39.840
when Jim Becker went over to Geneva to talk to the Iraqi delegation about

06:39.840 --> 06:43.240
possibly having a ceasefire and I didn't have to see fire but peace talks before

06:43.240 --> 06:48.240
the war started we pulled back for a for a few days and of course when the

06:48.240 --> 06:53.340
Iraqi delegation said they were gonna set up the peace talks we moved up

06:53.340 --> 06:57.760
north again a lot of the time though when you were there just sort of in a

06:57.760 --> 07:01.880
waiting mode you weren't just sitting around playing football playing volleyball

07:01.880 --> 07:05.520
you're training you there were a lot of training there was a lot of training to

07:05.520 --> 07:10.040
be done to get ready for what might happen as far as enemy recognition things

07:10.040 --> 07:13.200
like that sort of talk about the the constant training you were doing to

07:13.200 --> 07:19.760
prepare well from the time we landed at the Kubar towers till till till the

07:19.760 --> 07:23.840
air war started until the ground were started training was taken very seriously

07:23.840 --> 07:27.480
from what young soldiers are like young kids today they don't take a lot of

07:27.480 --> 07:30.760
things seriously until things happen to you go to the gas chamber or something

07:30.760 --> 07:35.400
like that experience that but actually that the younger soldiers were demanding

07:35.400 --> 07:40.440
more training they wanted to feel more secure and have a understanding we had a

07:40.440 --> 07:43.880
lot of new equipment that was issued us that we had never had before the

07:43.880 --> 07:48.480
Magellan GPS is what we drive around the day with the the Tom Tom's and so on

07:48.480 --> 07:53.960
so forth we experienced that very for the first time when we were there we

07:53.960 --> 07:57.160
had the Magellan was called the Magellan GPS we were unfamiliar with it and

07:57.160 --> 08:00.400
didn't do a lot of good in the middle of desert other than giving you one

08:00.400 --> 08:07.120
grid point to the next but NBC training weapons qualification still continued

08:07.120 --> 08:16.000
constant upcheek of equipment our M1 Abrams tanks went through retro armor

08:16.000 --> 08:20.040
outfit while we were there within a two or three week period so it was a

08:20.040 --> 08:24.600
constant training and constantly upgrading our equipment it's hard to believe

08:24.600 --> 08:30.040
it's been 17 years since that air ride January 15th 1991 early 18 years now but

08:30.040 --> 08:33.920
I would imagine that anybody in their in their upper 20s or at least 30

08:33.920 --> 08:38.480
years old probably can remember where they were at least on the you know on

08:38.480 --> 08:42.760
the stateside watching television that night I know I personally was up all

08:42.760 --> 08:49.080
night long watching I guess I guess CNN was the the main network of a choice

08:49.080 --> 08:53.840
there as far as 24 hour coverage of it but that night talk about the

08:53.840 --> 08:58.060
perspective that you had the night that the the air war started in deserts

08:58.060 --> 09:02.460
storm well the night the air war started in desert storm we were we were in a

09:02.460 --> 09:09.340
camp and we knew something was going to happen we didn't know exactly when we

09:09.340 --> 09:13.980
knew the deadline was coming up and at 12 o'clock that time I'm not sure what

09:13.980 --> 09:20.660
time it was back in our state was late or earlier today but but we had

09:20.660 --> 09:24.580
aircraft over are we at the call to go to all our fighting positions so we all

09:24.580 --> 09:29.560
went out to our foxholes and as we're running out there the F-16s and the F-15s

09:29.560 --> 09:34.500
were flying right dead over camps at a combat flight level I remember so

09:34.500 --> 09:39.700
that we had a soldier of mine had a 60 the M-60 machine gun was taking the M-60

09:39.700 --> 09:42.220
machine gun out to the fighting position he didn't have his chin strap on

09:42.220 --> 09:46.300
and the blues helmet off the suction from the from the jets flying over and

09:46.300 --> 09:49.920
so everybody kind of chained up the straps and gotten a fighting

09:49.920 --> 09:53.220
positions because you're like two or three feet deeper than you were standing

09:53.220 --> 09:58.060
on top of the ground being there so very very interesting we heard the

09:58.060 --> 10:03.220
bombers fly over and at night we'd we'd sit there where we're in a fighting

10:03.220 --> 10:07.740
position you could feel the ground thump feel the concussion from the bombs

10:07.740 --> 10:10.020
they were dropping on some of the airfields just on the other side of the

10:10.020 --> 10:14.100
border like so we were still quite a waste from bagged out that time I doubt it

10:14.100 --> 10:18.260
was bagged in we were we were amazed on the pitchers we saw that come through

10:18.260 --> 10:22.540
the Stars and Stripes newspaper that we got that still came to us periodically

10:22.540 --> 10:27.620
during the war the pictures of bagged out and all the all the N.I. air fire and

10:27.620 --> 10:30.740
so and so forth that was happening there in the videos I saw but when I got

10:30.740 --> 10:35.060
back I was so rather impressed that we didn't lose more than we did right but

10:35.060 --> 10:38.500
it was a very very successful campaign if it we wouldn't have had a successful

10:38.500 --> 10:42.820
campaign in the air we would not have had a successful ground campaign right you

10:42.820 --> 10:47.420
talked about the well that has been on as we get closer to the air to the

10:47.420 --> 10:51.780
ground war let's go ahead and go there February 21 1991 that was the day that

10:51.780 --> 10:56.140
the ground war started talk about what your role was as a as a humvee driver

10:56.140 --> 11:02.340
well I was the NBC which is nuclear biological and chemical squadron NBC and

11:02.340 --> 11:08.140
CO and my secondary duty over there was the driver's training in CO and I drove

11:08.140 --> 11:12.620
the the squadron maintenance officer and I drove the squadron NBC officer and

11:12.620 --> 11:16.940
then I also drove for a few other staff positional officers that were

11:16.940 --> 11:19.900
there some lieutenant and so and so forth that worked for the squadron commander

11:19.900 --> 11:26.140
took in the meetings and so and so forth the main job is NBC at the camp was

11:26.140 --> 11:31.180
to make sure all the monitors and alarms were set up and prepared in case

11:31.180 --> 11:35.620
something did go off that we would do what we had to do by running our test

11:35.620 --> 11:40.580
you know the night that the ground war started we talked about this

11:40.580 --> 11:44.900
yesterday we were sitting up at the berm and and that night we knew that we

11:44.900 --> 11:50.540
were going to have a situation where the squadron commander and the squadron

11:50.540 --> 11:53.660
sergeant major said you don't need everybody get sleep tonight you and all your

11:53.660 --> 11:57.820
soldiers we had MPs in that were the perimeter because not even a quarter a

11:57.820 --> 12:00.700
mile away from us with us was this berm on the other side of this berm was

12:00.700 --> 12:06.460
Iraqi soldiers and fighting positions and then the artillery and

12:06.460 --> 12:09.980
MLRS units moved up in the middle of the night about two o'clock in the

12:09.980 --> 12:14.860
morning they they started letting loose tell them about MLRS is multi-lotters

12:14.860 --> 12:19.060
rockets is not a long rocket system just something that I had never experienced

12:19.060 --> 12:22.900
that before I've experienced the 105 Howard serves and things like that by

12:22.900 --> 12:26.340
doing training with them at the National Training Center in California but it

12:26.340 --> 12:30.580
was my first experience with MLRS and it was the prettiest firework show you

12:30.580 --> 12:34.820
ever see and you know what and he kept you up at night too right yeah I mean

12:34.820 --> 12:38.020
we were hard to sleep we probably would sit up most of the night talking before

12:38.020 --> 12:42.340
things happen out of the non-commissioned officers did and and that night we

12:42.340 --> 12:46.220
probably just started buzzing out and it's probably about two o'clock when when

12:46.220 --> 12:48.900
all that stuff started taking off and of course you couldn't sleep through that

12:48.900 --> 12:53.220
when we visited you talked about the helicopter the Apache the Black Hawk's

12:53.220 --> 12:58.660
the Cobras and they really saved your bacon on more than one occasion the

12:58.660 --> 13:05.220
job that these that is aircraft dead which is incredible yeah the being in

13:05.220 --> 13:11.820
a cavalry we had our primary vehicles were the M1 Abrams M3 Bradley vehicle of

13:11.820 --> 13:17.860
course we had multiple M577s which were tactical meeting vehicles but our

13:17.860 --> 13:24.380
biggest savior there Verna's kind of conflict was the the Apache's the

13:24.380 --> 13:29.380
Cobras and the Black Hawks and of course there were still some Hueys and OH-58

13:29.380 --> 13:35.580
Delta's which is a K.O.W. Warrior that the scouts use yeah the the

13:35.580 --> 13:40.820
Apache's and the Cobras were very very much saved our bacon and very

13:40.820 --> 13:44.340
impressive to watch is that right very impressive to watch you know we we

13:44.340 --> 13:49.900
seen that we seen the Abrams tanks and so on so forth go through and we knew

13:49.900 --> 13:52.860
what they were capable of doing a lot of us didn't get to have life fire

13:52.860 --> 13:57.740
exercises with our with our air crews and that was amazing to watch you were

13:57.740 --> 14:01.860
obviously impressed about the organization of the United States the Allied

14:01.860 --> 14:05.740
forces the enemy was pretty impressed also weren't it yeah I think the

14:05.740 --> 14:09.620
over they were very I mean the coalition forces that we have were very

14:09.620 --> 14:14.660
overwhelming to them we knew that the Iraqi army was going to be a tough

14:14.660 --> 14:19.860
army we just weren't sure how tough they just come out of what 10 year 8 to 10

14:19.860 --> 14:24.300
year war with Iran so they were very combat veteran trained and we had

14:24.300 --> 14:28.340
hadn't had a lot of experience since Grenada and that was usually most

14:28.340 --> 14:31.900
that was special forces special ops that took care of that so we were really an

14:31.900 --> 14:36.500
untested army at that time and with that training Roy proved to really help

14:36.500 --> 14:40.460
let's go to some photographs right now and they will come back and we'll visit

14:40.460 --> 14:45.380
some more some of the pictures that Bob Brunner has supplied to us we talked about

14:45.380 --> 14:50.540
the berm this is the berm yeah that's about that that's about that 15-foot tall

14:50.540 --> 14:55.060
berm and he's about probably about three or four foot up standing up taking a

14:55.060 --> 14:58.340
picture of me up and at this time we had this picture we didn't realize that

14:58.340 --> 15:03.820
there was an enemy Iraqi soldiers probably another 25 foot on the other side

15:03.820 --> 15:08.540
there in firing positions because I mean it went about another 10 or 15

15:08.540 --> 15:12.940
about another 10 foot behind me there that you could walk on and of course we

15:12.940 --> 15:15.940
found we saw the fighting positions when the ground were started you're smiling

15:15.940 --> 15:21.420
for the photo yeah yeah Sergeant Major kind of got on us after this picture

15:21.420 --> 15:25.980
here so what are you idiots doing yeah because the enemy's watching you too okay

15:25.980 --> 15:32.460
let's move on next photograph this is myself one of our maintenance

15:32.460 --> 15:38.540
inceos and another one of the scouts for the for the calf and we're one of our

15:38.540 --> 15:43.220
setup areas here those are the Bradley's on a perimeter back behind us of course

15:43.220 --> 15:46.580
was camouflage not the green camouflage did a lot of good out in the middle

15:46.580 --> 15:53.860
desert but we were coming back or going to a meeting at this time okay next

15:53.860 --> 15:59.020
one but me and a buddy of mine another Sergeant Dave Woolman and this is his

15:59.020 --> 16:02.500
decent half truck he had with supplies in the back of it this is on the way

16:02.500 --> 16:06.400
going back home because you notice we don't have any flak vest or no weapons or

16:06.400 --> 16:10.460
anything honest this is probably right at the border by wrecking Saudi

16:10.460 --> 16:19.180
Arabia going back home and getting ready to come down from everything okay these

16:19.180 --> 16:24.580
were some of the first peel to ABS captured during desert storm these gentlemen

16:24.580 --> 16:28.660
were noticed come walking up into our perimeter we went to our fighting

16:28.660 --> 16:32.260
positions because we didn't know how many people there were going to be I think

16:32.260 --> 16:36.700
there was like four PLWs here and if this picture right here is our medical

16:36.700 --> 16:42.740
officer medical personnel checking out the PLWs because we were very we treated

16:42.740 --> 16:50.780
our PLWs very well this is actually one of our checkpoints we had up in Iraq

16:50.780 --> 16:57.740
not too far from from Err in between Al-Nazari and Basra not probably about

16:57.740 --> 17:02.780
50 to 75 miles away from Baghdad we had a lot of civilians walking out in

17:02.780 --> 17:06.180
middle desert and we had to investigate what what deal was and kind of find out

17:06.180 --> 17:10.100
they had met military credentials they were trying to get out of their uniform

17:10.100 --> 17:14.660
so they wouldn't be combatties so and at that time we were still taking

17:14.660 --> 17:18.340
PLWs we brought them in of course once they saw us we were all best buddies

17:18.340 --> 17:22.380
and they just love President Bush oh absolutely we got another picture of

17:22.380 --> 17:27.780
them smiling and oh yeah peace on and this right here they're saying we love

17:27.780 --> 17:33.540
Bush so they were they were very happy that they they were captured by us and

17:33.540 --> 17:39.980
not by Sodom exactly exactly okay this promotion this is the day I got

17:39.980 --> 17:45.300
promoted to Staff Sergeant okay I wanted to include that one you had mentioned Err

17:45.300 --> 17:50.660
which is a place of a biblical history and talk a little bit about it and

17:50.660 --> 17:56.820
this is this is this is up by the Euphrates River in Iraq and didn't realize

17:56.820 --> 18:01.220
how biblical that part of Iraq was and our chap on told us there's a the

18:01.220 --> 18:06.820
Zurgat of Err is there and so we all went and it's in the book of Genesis of

18:06.820 --> 18:12.860
you are as an Err and we went there and it was just an amazing place and just

18:12.860 --> 18:16.540
outside of that is what they call Abraham City let's go to the next picture

18:16.540 --> 18:21.340
as a matter and that's me standing with with the with the guide we had was an

18:21.340 --> 18:24.900
Iraqi guide that that does noses whole area and it's worked with all the

18:24.900 --> 18:29.060
archaeologists this is area right here where they found a scroll that dealt with

18:29.060 --> 18:36.060
Abraham and what they pretty much think is Abraham's house wow very

18:36.060 --> 18:39.700
impressive this is we're gonna talk about this a little bit later we referred to

18:39.740 --> 18:44.460
it in the opening this was at the Safwan airfield where the cease fire was

18:44.460 --> 18:49.620
negotiated this is from a book called the Road to Safwan this photograph you're

18:49.620 --> 18:52.980
not in this picture but I just thought this was an impressive photograph now

18:52.980 --> 18:56.660
those are all my quarter horse buddies though that's a C-True 1st

18:56.660 --> 19:00.900
Guadalajorth cavalry we had a press day after Safwan and we'll get into that

19:00.900 --> 19:05.500
in a minute thank you know basically the whole airfield was set up with

19:05.500 --> 19:09.100
nothing but quarter horse or 1st Guadalajorth cavalry vehicles and it's

19:09.100 --> 19:12.700
this is so happen this is Charlie Troop and this is them they're at their at

19:12.700 --> 19:18.900
their in front of one of their cobras right the operation your operation

19:18.900 --> 19:23.300
change you got orders to go to Kuwait talk about that and it was sort of

19:23.300 --> 19:28.100
during this time that you really got to see the the ugly ugly underbelly of

19:28.100 --> 19:31.460
war and the horror of war also sort of talk about these change of orders

19:31.460 --> 19:36.140
yeah being in a cabin we were part of the first amphibious division and

19:36.140 --> 19:40.420
and which is a time-honored division it's been involved in most every conflict

19:40.420 --> 19:47.140
there is and being in one of the most decorated units in history was a real

19:47.140 --> 19:52.580
privilege and an honor to be with us and we we led the first amphibious division

19:52.580 --> 19:57.340
in the seventh core into Iraq once we got into Iraq the orders changed it said

19:57.340 --> 20:03.380
you guys are going to Kuwait so we cut across no roads all across country and

20:03.380 --> 20:09.140
it was late at night we got just got in broken to the the borders of Kuwait we

20:09.140 --> 20:12.020
had some small arms fire and some tanks were going on like I said the

20:12.020 --> 20:15.660
Apache's and the cobras really took care of us with the night vision goggles

20:15.660 --> 20:19.940
took a little bit of artillery nothing nothing nothing too close to work close

20:19.940 --> 20:24.420
to worry about but we saw these lights in the in a horizon and I'm like man

20:24.420 --> 20:27.140
maybe there's a truck stop down there we'll get a hamburger or something you

20:27.140 --> 20:31.380
know and you just kind of forget where you're at and kind of find out as the

20:31.380 --> 20:36.140
more drove it was the oil fires that the Iraq Army had knocked all the heads

20:36.140 --> 20:41.340
off the wells and set up their own oil on fire the Kuwaiti oil on fire because

20:41.340 --> 20:45.180
if they they couldn't have it then when he bells to have it right we came

20:45.180 --> 20:49.980
across the four-way interstate and it's called the Kuwait City Bosch-Raw

20:49.980 --> 20:59.420
highway and there we encountered the the from what the aircraft that

20:59.420 --> 21:03.260
taking care of all the Kuwaiti so I mean the Iraqi army that was told to

21:03.260 --> 21:05.960
leave had finally started leaving but they were bottled next up on the

21:05.960 --> 21:12.340
interstates and probably about a half mile deep or in about five miles you know

21:12.340 --> 21:15.740
one way or the other from one into the north and south on the highway on the

21:15.740 --> 21:21.100
interstate there was nothing but vehicles that night we had saw the the

21:21.100 --> 21:25.100
Air Force and the Marine Corps pilots and the Navy pilots come in and they

21:25.100 --> 21:30.780
really did a lot of destruction on the highway right and of course you know

21:30.780 --> 21:34.860
that the Iraq Army did their share of fire and back at the aircraft and if they

21:34.860 --> 21:38.220
went and fired back the aircraft let us go in it may not have proceeded

21:38.220 --> 21:42.340
what it did but they were still being combative so indeed indeed let's talk about

21:42.340 --> 21:47.220
soft one the orders to take the airfield at soft one and you found out that this

21:47.220 --> 21:50.480
was very important because this is where the ceasefire was going to be

21:50.480 --> 21:54.580
negotiated we were about 50 miles in front of the first infirm division and we

21:54.580 --> 21:59.980
right when we got to the Boswark Quake City there was a lot of death and

21:59.980 --> 22:07.820
destruction and we spent some time there bearing soldiers and giving proper

22:07.820 --> 22:14.140
burials and marking the graves because you can't have bodies around we moved

22:14.140 --> 22:18.220
out we got orders to take soft one airfield which was at the border of

22:18.220 --> 22:22.980
Quate in Iraq very pinpointed very small place we wonder what was so

22:22.980 --> 22:27.060
important about it but the whole 24th Republican Guard was protecting that

22:27.060 --> 22:31.820
airfield so we moved up in the afternoon and to get to the evening time my

22:31.820 --> 22:35.140
squadron commander talked to the Iraqi general Colonel that was on the

22:35.140 --> 22:38.820
other end of the radio and our squadron commander just demanded he leave the

22:38.820 --> 22:42.660
airfield immediately they didn't want to leave so front of me at first there

22:42.660 --> 22:47.340
was some smaller and fire went back and forth couple Bradley shots it was

22:47.340 --> 22:52.460
asked again you know you need to leave they chose still not to leave squadron

22:52.460 --> 22:57.380
commander called in the Apache's in the in the the Cobras and they flew over

22:57.380 --> 23:00.860
the hovered over the airfield over the Bradley's and all of a sudden the

23:00.860 --> 23:04.980
Iraqi Colonel or General whatever he was gone on saying okay we're leaving you

23:04.980 --> 23:09.820
know you got to give us 45 minutes as he says now you got a half hour so they

23:09.820 --> 23:14.100
started backing off and moving off the airfield we kept your soft one airfield

23:14.100 --> 23:19.220
kind of find out soft one airfield was a the prime point where the cease

23:19.220 --> 23:25.340
fire was signed within a day or two General Schwarzkopf flew in talked to our

23:25.340 --> 23:29.860
unit and graduated us on a job well done and told us we had to get the airfield

23:29.860 --> 23:34.940
ready for this is where this the cease-fire talks we're gonna be held at we

23:34.940 --> 23:39.340
moved a bunch of enemy equipment up surrounding the airfield and when General

23:39.340 --> 23:45.980
Schwarzkopf came up again he says boys he says you know I wanted to let the Iraqi

23:45.980 --> 23:50.140
army know that we were serious not in baryson so we had to move some of that

23:50.140 --> 23:55.460
equipment back off and that the next day General Schwarzkopf flew in with his

23:55.460 --> 24:01.220
his bodyguards and his detail on and four four black hawks and that same day the

24:01.220 --> 24:05.740
Iraqi delegation drove up in a convoy surrounded by Bradley's the patches and

24:05.740 --> 24:11.660
in Cobras it was an Iraqi general that came in and talked to General Schwarzkopf

24:11.700 --> 24:15.940
and of course at that time it was pretty much a high security deal and we just kind

24:15.940 --> 24:21.340
of pulled pull perimeter guard on the airfield right but you can say that you were

24:21.340 --> 24:24.940
there when yeah I was the end was planned when the end was to go shaded and

24:24.940 --> 24:28.580
agreed upon yeah after everything was said and done General Schwarzkopf pulled

24:28.580 --> 24:33.260
the whole unit by and said you boys did a really fine job and to reward you

24:33.260 --> 24:36.580
what do you guys want we said we want some hamburgers or some mistakes so he

24:36.580 --> 24:42.580
sent up I think three refrauer try treathers full of four meat right and some beer

24:42.580 --> 24:49.260
right what kind Schlitz near beer but hey it was wet right yeah that was all that

24:49.260 --> 24:55.860
was all was we've got a couple of minutes left and and I'm glad we do tell

24:55.860 --> 25:02.300
us about your granddad well I've got a long long history of a family that has

25:02.300 --> 25:05.980
served that's kind of what many is patriotic as I am but my biological

25:05.980 --> 25:11.820
grandfather was a shot down in war two he was a navigator in a B29 shot down

25:11.820 --> 25:18.340
over Japan over the island of Kaio Shoe was taken to Kaio Shoe University in

25:18.340 --> 25:24.380
where he was a vivisection which means dissected by the by the Japanese

25:24.380 --> 25:29.740
University there right and there was a book written about that as a matter of

25:29.740 --> 25:34.740
fact yeah and you have that books a matter of fact we got a picture here of the

25:34.740 --> 25:38.060
cover of that book and that's it right there only that on the screen for a

25:38.060 --> 25:42.060
second is called of the fall as you can see a true story of American POW

25:42.060 --> 25:46.220
some Japanese wartime atrocities and that was his unit and that is your

25:46.220 --> 25:50.180
biological granddad top row on the right top row on the right kind of like he's

25:50.180 --> 25:55.660
got his hand in a shirt there and that was taken at Guam probably not too long

25:55.660 --> 26:00.500
before they were shot down I mean I'm not gonna say how how soon because I'm

26:00.500 --> 26:03.940
not really sure when that picture was taken but I know they weren't on Guam very

26:03.940 --> 26:11.700
long right right and your your grandmother of course after this happened

26:11.700 --> 26:15.660
remarried to the man that you knew as your granddad of course but this is

26:15.660 --> 26:18.420
certainly a history of World War II and a book written that's certainly

26:18.420 --> 26:22.860
obviously very very meaningful to you still the greatest generation exactly

26:22.860 --> 26:28.500
exactly that's very impressive your past commander of VFW post 4692

26:28.500 --> 26:32.900
something that you're very proud of and we can do a whole other show about what

26:32.900 --> 26:36.980
the VFW does and but in the few seconds that we have left talk a little bit

26:36.980 --> 26:40.180
about the VFW because I know that you're trying to bring in younger and younger

26:40.180 --> 26:45.780
members well the VFW's goal in life is to under the dead by serving the living

26:45.780 --> 26:50.860

26:54.900 --> 27:00.140
political action community in Washington DC where we fight for a GI Bill and

27:00.140 --> 27:06.940
