Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley. I'm Tom Turboville. Join the Navy and see

00:41.800 --> 00:46.520
the world. And indeed Lieutenant Commander Garland Bayless of College Station saw most

00:46.520 --> 00:53.040
of it in his two-year service aboard auxiliary personnel 149, a troop transport ship during

00:53.040 --> 00:59.600
World War II. It was a vessel built only as a transport and varied up to 3,000 from

00:59.600 --> 01:06.640
one town or island to another. It took some back from war from home and some from home

01:06.640 --> 01:14.000
into that. You know I messed that up when I was rehearsing it. I wrote it right. I just

01:14.000 --> 01:21.040
can't say it. Sorry about that. That happens about three times a year. So congratulations

01:21.040 --> 01:26.760
you were here for me. No you didn't. No no I messed my... Let me look at it and see. I

01:26.760 --> 01:33.080
know I wrote it right. It's just awkward for me to see. I wrote it the way I meant to

01:33.080 --> 01:39.740
read it. It's just that there's my eyes aren't. It was a vessel built only as a transport

01:39.740 --> 01:46.360
and varied up to up to 3,000 from one town or island to another. It took some back home

01:46.360 --> 01:51.360
from war and some from home into war. That's exactly what I wanted. It took some. Okay.

01:51.360 --> 01:59.640
I'm going to read that. I got it tangled a little bit there. Okay. Sorry about that.

01:59.640 --> 02:09.520
They need stuff for their Christmas party tape. That's why I did that. Okay.

03:16.360 --> 03:24.560
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley. I'm Tom Turviville. Join the Navy and see

03:24.560 --> 03:29.520
the world and indeed Lieutenant Commander Garland Bayless of College Station saw most of

03:29.520 --> 03:35.500
it in his two-year service aboard Auxiliary Personnel 149. A troop transport ship

03:35.500 --> 03:41.560
very World War II. It was a vessel built only as a transport and varied up to 3,000

03:41.560 --> 03:48.520
from one town or island to another. It took some back home from war and some from home

03:48.520 --> 03:54.640
into war. It was on the water both in the Pacific and Atlantic for two years and he traveled

03:54.640 --> 04:01.560
some 125,000 nautical miles. In all Garland Bayless spent 30 years in the Navy and the reserves

04:01.560 --> 04:06.820
and then later spent 34 years as a professor of history at Texas A&M. Please welcome

04:06.820 --> 04:11.700
Garland Bayless to Veterans of the Valley. Garland is not to know you. I've known you

04:11.700 --> 04:16.200
for some time and to have you here on Veterans of the Valley finally. Let's talk a little

04:16.200 --> 04:20.540
bit about growing up. You grew up in McGee, Arkansas. That is correct. Southeast part of

04:20.540 --> 04:25.580
the state. Talk about growing up in McGee. Well, McGee was a small country town about 3,000,

04:25.580 --> 04:32.340
18 miles from Mississippi River, 40 miles north of Louisiana. Your railroad town is since

04:32.340 --> 04:39.340
like the railroad family. Also cotton and corn. Rule. The country folks all came to town

04:39.340 --> 04:43.420
on Saturday. I won't go into what is called Furnish Day. You probably never heard of

04:43.420 --> 04:48.720
it. That's when the landowner's furnished their tenants with money to make the ensuing

04:48.720 --> 04:55.700
crop. Got out of high school there. Started college in Monticello, Arkansas, then Arkansas

04:55.700 --> 05:03.460
A&M, then University of Arkansas at Monticello. Very small school. Virtue no men left. 206

05:03.460 --> 05:08.620
coastal artillery battery been activated and sent to Alaska. That left a ratio about

05:08.620 --> 05:12.460
four women with every boy, which is pretty good. One of a deal. One of a deal. Want to go

05:12.460 --> 05:16.420
back to your family? Your family was in the railroad business. Your dad was a conductor.

05:16.420 --> 05:20.060
That's right. Two brothers were conductors. And two brothers were. And they were thus exempt

05:20.060 --> 05:27.060
from the draft. Right. My two other brothers both drafted. One spent over four years overseas,

05:27.060 --> 05:31.660
another three and a half years before they got home. Right. There was station one went from

05:31.660 --> 05:38.220
North Africa to Sicily to Italy, into France and into Germany before the war was over.

05:38.220 --> 05:43.460
Exactly. The other was station off the Persian Gulf in Basra, part of the Lin-Lise program

05:43.460 --> 05:50.740
of the United States to Russia and reverse. Right. You went from Arkansas to, you talked

05:50.740 --> 05:55.500
about the programs of E1 program that eventually became a V12 program. And it had to do with

05:55.500 --> 05:59.740
education, how many semesters. And they talk about sort of how that worked and eventually

05:59.740 --> 06:03.820
how that got you to Columbia University. Well, in November of 42, we all knew we're going

06:03.820 --> 06:09.460
to do something. 18, debating in college storms, what to do. I said I'm going to the

06:09.460 --> 06:13.840
United States and Garland Dose, you can't swim very well. North L1 being a fox over in the

06:13.840 --> 06:19.660
Army. So in winter, little rock Arkansas in November 1942 joined what was called the Navy

06:19.660 --> 06:26.700
of V1 program. The theory here that were theory was you would stay in that program to receive

06:26.700 --> 06:31.540
your degree and then you go to offices, Canada's got a Navy achievement. To all progress,

06:31.540 --> 06:39.900
the need to officers that cut that down to the V1 program. Arkansas, Monticello at Arkansas,

06:39.900 --> 06:46.780
Monticello was one of those schools. So I put on a uniform along with guys who in the Marine

06:46.780 --> 06:51.500
Corps, including Tom Chandler, who was in the Marine Corps that I didn't know Tom then,

06:51.500 --> 06:55.660
I formed a head baseball coach. You know you were together until you got here. I got here,

06:55.660 --> 07:00.380
that is correct. And so after a total of five semesters, we got three, got two, whatever,

07:00.380 --> 07:05.900
I was sent to Columbia University in New York City to the Navy of Michigan School for a 90-day

07:05.900 --> 07:11.620
program to convert me hopefully into a Naval officer. You talked about how a country boy from

07:11.620 --> 07:16.500
New York, Arkansas going up to New York City, that was quite a culture shock. Very much. I'd been

07:16.500 --> 07:22.220
in New Orleans once, in a little rock a lot of times. They were then small. So I go from there to

07:22.220 --> 07:27.940
New York, like thousands and thousands of people pulled out of the farms or early areas in the cities

07:27.940 --> 07:33.460
to different environments. And I walked to streets in New York, looking at tall buildings. First

07:33.460 --> 07:38.260
time I had liberty, I got lost with the wrong place. I finally got back to Columbia University.

07:38.260 --> 07:45.340
Right. And I was commissioned there in early October in 1944. Now when you left Columbia and came

07:45.340 --> 07:49.300
back home on your way to the West Coast to be deployed, did you know at that time where you were

07:49.300 --> 07:52.620
going to be assigned that you were assigned to a transport. Now we're heading our orders.

07:52.620 --> 07:58.140
They already had your orders. And they gave me 10-day leave in route to California's Long Beach.

07:58.140 --> 08:03.460
You pick up my ship. And that ship at that point in May, only one trip. And that was to Hawaii.

08:03.460 --> 08:11.140
Right. They took 400 of various types of personnel there. We loaded in Long Beach a mixed group,

08:11.140 --> 08:21.580
OSS, which was a precursor of the CIA, Red Cross personnel, and Army Muil Pack Outfit. We did not

08:21.580 --> 08:28.540
have the Muil, we took him to Calcutta. They got their Muils. And then they had a Muil Pack

08:28.540 --> 08:36.700
train across the Lido road from Indian to China. So they trained in Colorado, interesting,

08:36.700 --> 08:43.100
interesting people. That's the one thing about your service and your deployment was that you

08:43.100 --> 08:48.780
met all kinds of people in who you transported. Let's go back. You went home and you went to San Francisco.

08:49.180 --> 08:56.380
Talk about Long Beach that time. Right. Long Beach. Talk about the vessel. It was named after a

08:56.380 --> 09:02.220
General J. H. McCray, who I looked up and found out that he was a military man of the 1800s. I

09:02.220 --> 09:08.860
don't know much more about his military either. But it was actually called the AP Auxiliary Personnel 149.

09:08.860 --> 09:14.700
Talk a little bit about the ship. It was a large ship obviously because you were able to bring

09:14.700 --> 09:22.060
aboard 3,000 plus a crew of how many? About 430. About 430. Talk about the ship. Was it pretty crowded?

09:22.060 --> 09:28.620
Well, it was pretty crowded. As indicated in the earlier marks, it was built as a transport

09:28.620 --> 09:36.300
in the Kaiser shipyards. It was not a conversion. So we were set up. We fed our, compliment our troops,

09:37.020 --> 09:42.300
three meals a day. Many just got two. But we were so designed that we could turn it down. And we

09:42.300 --> 09:47.100
knew how many were going to every compartment. Right. And so we loaded these troops. We would send

09:47.100 --> 09:52.940
the top and count them down. One poor guy in Long Beach at my banning ship station came there

09:52.940 --> 09:59.660
with his helmet liner. He was C. C. Every time I saw him. He always had his helmet liner. And those

09:59.660 --> 10:05.180
you guys are in the Marine Corps know what the helmet liner is. And it had many uses. One was to

10:05.180 --> 10:11.980
catch whatever you had. Exactly. He was throwing up in California. In the Calcutta. Right. We made

10:11.980 --> 10:17.100
one stop in the route at Melbourne, Australia. It was 40 days and 40 nights. Right. They get from

10:17.100 --> 10:21.580
California through Melbourne into Calcutta. I'm going to talk about that trip a little bit more

10:21.580 --> 10:28.060
in a minute. But talk about what your, your job on the ship was just a little bit of everything.

10:28.060 --> 10:35.260
It was one specific job. A junior officer reporting aboard the vessel then. A lot of OJT on the

10:35.260 --> 10:40.380
job training. They take you aboard and you will spend three or four weeks of, can you,

10:40.380 --> 10:44.460
aviation officer three or four weeks of the first lieutenant who was in charge of all the day,

10:45.100 --> 10:50.380
three or four weeks for the navigation officer. And you made this circular around. I hired

10:50.380 --> 10:55.980
I did not get that OJT on job training with the engineer and officer. I come back then just a

10:55.980 --> 11:02.060
moment. And at the same time you're being trained as an officer day. You would call the J OOD

11:02.060 --> 11:06.940
junior officer day. And that was three months training period. At the end of that you within

11:07.660 --> 11:15.100
seven. Said to be an officer day. Now what that meant is remember that ship was 417 feet long,

11:15.100 --> 11:22.700
78 feet on the beam and about 17,000 times. And so you had this crew of 400 plus, you were from

11:22.700 --> 11:29.020
2,800, 3000 troops. And you're a sail in the ocean blue and you're responsible doing that four

11:29.020 --> 11:34.700
hours you have the watch. And if you have any problem you call the skipper his cabin was just behind

11:34.700 --> 11:40.620
the bridge. So that's what you trained to become officer of the day. And when you were off

11:40.620 --> 11:44.220
to the day of the day. The skipper might be in taking a nap. You were in charge of the

11:44.220 --> 11:50.540
whoever he was asleep. Whoever had the watch. Right. It was your responsibility. That's already

11:50.540 --> 11:56.460
heavy for 20 year old boy. I bet it is. Yeah I want to talk about that more later. Your first trip

11:56.460 --> 12:01.660
from California you said stopped in Melbourne to Calcutta. It was a little bit unique in that you

12:01.660 --> 12:08.140
had a escort. You said you had a 10 can of destroyer. You had a munitionship an oiler. But

12:08.700 --> 12:13.660
that didn't work out the way you wanted it. Well not exactly. We always steamed the loan except for

12:13.660 --> 12:19.580
this. Right. The only time we were in a small convoy with escort. We had this all-strain destroyer

12:19.580 --> 12:25.500
10 can. Just ahead of us we were in the center just behind. Porton Starborough was munitionship

12:25.500 --> 12:31.340
in an order. So we were steaming long men and own business. Next thing was mid afternoon. We

12:31.340 --> 12:37.020
see the destroyer throwing depth charge off the stern. He thought he had a submarine. How far

12:37.020 --> 12:43.980
behind are you? Oh my goodness. Maybe a hundred yards. Okay. Yes. I have to think pretty for about

12:43.980 --> 12:48.060
a hundred yards. Yeah. Yeah. That's tough enough. That's a soft pitching wedge. Yes.

12:49.500 --> 12:54.860
So we had a veer of starboard and avoid the munitionship. Nothing happened but there was a

12:54.860 --> 12:59.980
conversation between the two skippers. They were supposed to tell us before they dropped the

12:59.980 --> 13:04.860
depth charges. Now had it been a jam summary now. We've been happy or Japanese summary. What

13:04.860 --> 13:08.860
I'm supposed to say now. You would have liked to have known. So you wouldn't be on top of it.

13:08.860 --> 13:12.060
That's right. So you had to do a little bit. If you was down here, he'd me have scared him off too.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.700
So after that y'all decided you'd rather be alone. You can handle this by yourself.

13:16.700 --> 13:21.180
Well we never go in the opportunity. Right. So we sail all over the Atlantic, the Indian,

13:21.180 --> 13:27.100
the China Sea, wherever we went we were always alone except for that one time. Exactly. What

13:27.100 --> 13:34.780
you do is zigzag. You have a panty starboard degree so on. What are it maybe? You talked about

13:34.780 --> 13:40.540
the passengers on that first trip and you started to talk about that. OSS, Office of Strategic

13:40.540 --> 13:46.140
Service, which is sort of pre-CIA. And Mule Pack out there out of Colorado, Red Cross,

13:46.140 --> 13:54.860
and others. It was really a pulporeo. We had a few laps. That was okay. That was okay.

13:55.820 --> 14:01.980
Well there's a story that I can't tell you. Not with me, some better. Better or not.

14:03.260 --> 14:08.380
Out of Calcutta, you talked about how you had elements of the 20th Air Force that you were taking

14:08.380 --> 14:13.420
to Tinian Island where they were going to stage for the bombing of Japan. So talk a little bit more

14:13.420 --> 14:19.580
about that. Well that's right. We came into Calcutta of the Hubei River, which is a tributary of

14:19.660 --> 14:26.380
the Ganges. Larger ship they'd ever seen to know how to tie us up. But finally got us tied up.

14:27.020 --> 14:32.540
And we all floated the people that we had there. And there's still an army lieutenant looking for me

14:32.540 --> 14:37.260
because while there he bought a suitcase, a cigarette lighter, and something else

14:37.260 --> 14:42.220
that I spoke to his wife when I got back to the States. I never found the address. So he's

14:42.220 --> 14:48.780
probably still a fuss at that sailor who took his goods. Not deliberately. But we get into Calcutta

14:48.860 --> 14:53.660
but there are about three or four days. And then that's when we load elements of the 20th Air Force.

14:54.060 --> 14:59.260
Three days, we started getting messages under wave from Tokyo Rose who was part of their

14:59.260 --> 15:05.180
psychological warfare. We would be sent three days out of Calcutta. She knew the name of our

15:05.180 --> 15:10.220
Skipper T.R. Cali, the name of the Colonel commanding the elements of the 20th, and where we'd be

15:10.220 --> 15:15.340
in and where we were going. That makes you anxious to say the least. Exactly. And we were at

15:16.300 --> 15:22.860
General Quarters, oh probably 24 to 36 hours. But nothing happened but that was part of it.

15:23.500 --> 15:27.820
And she got our attention. It made us anxious. The psychological warfare.

15:27.820 --> 15:32.780
The psychological warfare. Exactly. So you were expecting any time that it couldn't be.

15:32.780 --> 15:37.820
Yeah, it was a legitimate threat. Did they know who you are and who you've been and who you're going?

15:37.820 --> 15:43.020
That's right. So you had to be ready. And General Quarters for over a day, almost 24 hours.

15:43.820 --> 15:51.740
Right. Right. At 10 a.m., you steam the empty to New Guinea. And talk about that. It was about

15:52.460 --> 15:59.180
when you got to New Guinea, the people that you loaded on the time. We unloaded. I think there's

15:59.180 --> 16:06.380
about 2,700 these. All these soldiers and nurses had been in New Guinea anywhere. We understood

16:06.380 --> 16:12.220
from 24 to 28 some 36 months. I can't be exact. I'm going on the stories they told us.

16:12.220 --> 16:17.180
Right. And they're all over Yellow from Taken, Adderbrim. Many had jungle rods at fungal

16:18.060 --> 16:23.980
that you pick up. I was only at three days. I managed to get on my right foot, took years,

16:23.980 --> 16:31.020
ever get rid of it. But we loaded these folks aboard. Many were in pretty bad shape. We had

16:31.020 --> 16:35.980
this one soldier. He would sit, put his head back into bulkhead and look at the other one.

16:35.980 --> 16:42.060
And we called the bulkhead stayer. He just sat there and looked at nothing except another steel bulkhead.

16:43.180 --> 16:50.140
We had one army nurse who had apparently having psychological problems. She had jungle rod very badly.

16:50.140 --> 16:58.380
It could not keep close. We had improvising padded chill. A place for her. Then we had one soldier to die.

16:58.940 --> 17:04.380
None of us had how to conduct a barrel at sea. So we broke out the manual. The carpenter made the

17:05.020 --> 17:12.060
wooden rack. We sold him in canvas, put shells and other weights in there. The chaplain said

17:12.060 --> 17:19.180
the appropriate words. And as you're seeing the movies, we dumped him into the sea.

17:19.900 --> 17:23.900
We didn't want to do that very often. That was the only time that that happened.

17:24.700 --> 17:33.900
We did not have the silics to keep the body. Exactly. You talked about this was in the beginning

17:33.900 --> 17:42.300
where they had been actually ending at about 27-28 months. Something like that. You talked about the

17:42.300 --> 17:55.020
burial at sea. Talk a little bit more about the boat itself. You said it was a crowded situation.

17:55.020 --> 17:59.820
Was it one of the boats where you always had to duck around and bump ahead a lot of places?

18:00.380 --> 18:09.180
You're always bumping your head. I had to hit my head. I had to hit my head.

18:09.180 --> 18:15.340
But no, it was for the troops. It's especially crowded. We gave them freedom beyond

18:15.340 --> 18:21.740
topside anytime they wanted to. Of course, we always had to alert them when your topside

18:21.740 --> 18:27.100
at dark do not strike a match to light your cigarette. You can see a struck match in the

18:27.180 --> 18:33.500
butt of that cigarette. About 14-16 miles. It's where the earth's curvature is such that it's

18:33.500 --> 18:39.980
no longer visible. But that's an open signal for anybody who may be out there who might want to

18:39.980 --> 18:46.140
take a shot at you. Now, our guys learned pretty quickly. Later, I mentioned the Australian troops.

18:46.140 --> 18:51.980
Right. Now go ahead and do that. You liked the Australia. You gave a lot of respect to them in

18:52.060 --> 18:57.980
their country. No, we and all of that. But sometimes you had to. Well, we went into towns of

18:57.980 --> 19:05.980
Australia. This is our second visit to Australia. We loaded again about 2,820, 150 Australian troops.

19:06.940 --> 19:11.980
As they came aboard, I was standing at the head of the gang, we leading down to a compartment

19:11.980 --> 19:18.540
held a hundred and two soldiers. Soon the word came up. Sir, there are no more bugs. I know

19:18.540 --> 19:23.660
they're bugs. So I went down. They were throwing the gear on one bump, got themselves the other.

19:23.660 --> 19:31.340
So I'm sorry guys. You only get one bug. So we worked that out. But there were very pleasant people.

19:31.340 --> 19:36.940
I like both Melbourne a great deal and Townsville a great deal. And the people we met interacted with.

19:36.940 --> 19:42.460
Now, just before we got into Townsville, we pushed our crew to chip and paint the deck.

19:42.460 --> 19:47.180
And you say, there knows what that means. You get on your deck, you chip all the loose paint,

19:47.180 --> 19:51.900
and you repaint it. Well, you want this shit with the trial Australian friends. So they come

19:51.900 --> 19:59.820
aboard with their hobnail boots. As I understand it, all soldiers in the British Empire were hobnails.

19:59.820 --> 20:05.500
And literally, if you look upside down, the whole bottom has a little nail head. It was for traction.

20:05.500 --> 20:11.340
Great if you need it. But in a couple days, you cannot find any paint on our deck. And our

20:11.340 --> 20:17.420
sailors not very, very happy. All their work had gone to naught. They'd worked hard on that day.

20:17.420 --> 20:24.140
You said that you were, we took those to Timor, T-I-M-O-R, for the Dutch East Indies.

20:24.140 --> 20:29.500
I see. You said that you never came under attack in those two years.

20:29.500 --> 20:34.140
Looking back, is that somewhat surprising considering that you were a true transport?

20:34.140 --> 20:37.980
And you would think from the enemy standpoint that that would be a prime target.

20:37.980 --> 20:41.580
You would think so. You would especially talk to your rosy who we were, what we were doing.

20:42.380 --> 20:48.940
But occasionally we had sightings of what appeared to be periscopes. But no one ever bothers

20:48.940 --> 20:54.540
when you were shot in angered anybody. And we're always thankful. Because honestly,

20:54.540 --> 21:01.980
when you're steaming the enemy of water with this Japanese or German, it worries you.

21:02.540 --> 21:07.900
Goes can always happen. And on our board, we had two five-inch-thirty-eighths,

21:09.340 --> 21:14.380
which are our main armament. We had 20 millimeters and 40 millimeters anti-aircraft.

21:14.380 --> 21:17.820
We've practiced a lot, but we never shot it angered.

21:17.820 --> 21:23.180
You mentioned when the Philippines to take back to the States before going to Europe via the

21:23.180 --> 21:27.500
Panama Canal. Let's get you over to the Atlantic after we look at some photographs.

21:27.580 --> 21:32.780
We've got some pictures that you have supplied us. And there is a young

21:32.780 --> 21:35.660
instant garland bailiff, I guess. You're not held where you think about it.

21:35.660 --> 21:37.420
Twenty.

21:37.420 --> 21:39.340
Twenty? Great hair.

21:39.340 --> 21:40.220
Great hair, thank you.

21:40.220 --> 21:41.740
Yeah, you bet. You bet.

21:42.940 --> 21:44.540
There's your ship.

21:44.540 --> 21:46.460
That's the mighty Mac, the terror that Pacific.

21:47.420 --> 21:51.420
There it is. The general J.H. McCray.

21:52.780 --> 21:54.460
Now, if you're one of the people in that nature.

21:54.460 --> 21:55.660
I'm one facing you.

21:55.660 --> 21:57.020
One facing you.

21:57.020 --> 21:59.420
With my hands on my hips, I'm not sure if I.

21:59.420 --> 22:00.060
Yeah.

22:00.060 --> 22:04.060
I think we were tied up there in Manas Island in the US.

22:04.780 --> 22:06.380
That is somewhere in the Atlantic.

22:07.820 --> 22:09.020
Was that a post picture?

22:09.020 --> 22:10.060
It was post.

22:10.060 --> 22:11.260
That's what I was thinking.

22:11.260 --> 22:13.100
Are you just sitting there just looking at a whole lot of water?

22:13.100 --> 22:15.020
No, I just want to sit over the water.

22:15.020 --> 22:19.580
Hey, said, yeah, it looks like it looks like it can be used for recruiting poster.

22:19.900 --> 22:25.420
I found this and I'm glad you did.

22:25.420 --> 22:29.740
And that's sort of a sketch of the same.

22:29.740 --> 22:32.300
See, if you look at it, the anchors not there yet.

22:32.300 --> 22:33.660
Right.

22:33.660 --> 22:36.860
Right. The US general J.H. McCray.

22:37.740 --> 22:39.180
And now, this is a Columbia, right?

22:39.180 --> 22:41.260
Columbia University in Midshipman's Coast.

22:41.260 --> 22:44.380
And there's the Corps of Midshipman in Parade right there.

22:45.900 --> 22:48.220
I want you to see every man there had a hat on.

22:48.220 --> 22:49.820
That was 1944.

22:49.820 --> 22:50.780
It was all military.

22:50.780 --> 22:51.740
It was our last picture.

22:51.740 --> 22:56.700
And like I say, that looks like a picture that could be on the Navy recruiting poster right there.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.220
That's a good looking sailor.

22:58.220 --> 22:58.860
Well, thank you.

22:58.860 --> 23:00.620
Boy, the white teeth and everything.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.060
That's a...

23:02.060 --> 23:02.700
And hair.

23:02.700 --> 23:03.180
And hair?

23:04.860 --> 23:06.540
But you got some dates from that picture.

23:06.540 --> 23:07.500
You hadn't met Mary yet.

23:07.500 --> 23:08.060
Oh, I can say that.

23:08.060 --> 23:08.700
No, no, no.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.060
They never hurt.

23:12.060 --> 23:14.460
We were talking about at...

23:15.420 --> 23:19.420
Now, I'm sorry, that picture we saw before was at Columbia or the Citadel.

23:19.420 --> 23:20.620
That was at Columbia.

23:20.620 --> 23:21.340
No.

23:21.340 --> 23:24.540
The other one was after I left Columbia because I already...

23:24.540 --> 23:25.820
I'd already been to Pacific.

23:25.820 --> 23:26.300
Right.

23:26.300 --> 23:27.420
And I was back home on leave.

23:27.420 --> 23:27.900
Okay.

23:27.900 --> 23:31.740
The one in the sailor outfit was just before I started midshipman's school.

23:31.740 --> 23:33.500
The picture of the review that we just looked at.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.060
That was in September 1944.

23:36.060 --> 23:36.380
Okay.

23:36.380 --> 23:37.180
In Columbia University.

23:37.180 --> 23:38.220
That Columbia University.

23:38.220 --> 23:38.620
Okay.

23:38.620 --> 23:43.500
Because we're going to get on later talking about the Citadel after later on.

23:44.460 --> 23:47.420
From the Pacific to the Atlantic through the Panama Canal

23:47.420 --> 23:48.300
and you went to...

23:48.300 --> 23:53.820
You landed at La Harfrant where again, the same job you picked up troops to come back to the states

23:53.820 --> 23:54.860
and wherever they needed to go.

23:54.860 --> 23:56.860
We took them back this time to Norfolk.

23:57.740 --> 24:01.660
The Atlantic Ocean was a little bit more of a challenge than the...

24:01.660 --> 24:02.380
You had some...

24:02.380 --> 24:05.740
Obviously, some challenges in the Pacific as far as the weather

24:05.740 --> 24:08.460
and the currents and the waves and the storms and all that.

24:08.460 --> 24:10.460
But the Atlantic was particularly mean, right?

24:10.460 --> 24:11.500
Well, you know...

24:11.500 --> 24:13.980
One thing, it's a smaller body of water.

24:14.780 --> 24:16.540
The storms can be bad in either.

24:16.540 --> 24:17.180
Right.

24:17.180 --> 24:19.820
But I think it was on that trail.

24:19.820 --> 24:21.260
No, it was on the New York.

24:22.380 --> 24:24.220
I guess you're asking about that heavy storm.

24:24.220 --> 24:24.540
Right.

24:24.540 --> 24:24.780
Yes, sir.

24:25.580 --> 24:31.980
In a normal steaming, we would do about 424 Nautical Mounds in 24 hours.

24:31.980 --> 24:32.940
That's 10 or 12 miles.

24:32.940 --> 24:33.740
Yeah, right.

24:33.740 --> 24:38.780
Then this one in particular storm in the North Atlantic is best we could figure.

24:38.780 --> 24:42.060
We may have made 11 Nautical Mounds forward.

24:42.780 --> 24:45.980
In those seas, all you can do is keep your balance to the sea

24:45.980 --> 24:47.900
that is where the waves are coming to you.

24:47.900 --> 24:51.580
If you ever fall off, then that wave hit you broadside

24:51.580 --> 24:52.860
and you're going to have to go over.

24:52.860 --> 24:53.100
Right.

24:53.100 --> 24:53.820
Right.

24:53.820 --> 24:55.980
Almost like rogue waves.

24:55.980 --> 24:56.300
Yeah.

24:56.300 --> 25:00.700
I think it was on the one in the Pacific.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.980
We had a sailor stand in there to watch our attack, not attack common.

25:03.980 --> 25:04.780
It's a device.

25:05.340 --> 25:07.340
It's a big thing with an era.

25:07.340 --> 25:10.780
As it goes to your right from the starboard,

25:10.780 --> 25:13.820
it would get down it with shutter and shutter and shutter.

25:13.820 --> 25:15.180
Then it would come back and shutter.

25:16.220 --> 25:19.420
And if you went beyond a certain point, you kept going.

25:20.300 --> 25:23.420
And one of the things we could have done about it, if it happened.

25:23.420 --> 25:23.900
Right.

25:23.900 --> 25:25.180
What you're saying, you're watching it.

25:25.980 --> 25:28.300
And especially if you're the OD, it helps the day.

25:30.140 --> 25:31.820
If that thing turned on, you're watching.

25:32.620 --> 25:33.660
It's bad scene.

25:33.660 --> 25:34.220
Exactly.

25:35.420 --> 25:38.140
You talked about some of the waves were hitting at 140 feet

25:38.140 --> 25:39.420
because they were coming over the side.

25:40.380 --> 25:40.860
Right.

25:40.860 --> 25:41.820
Tumptum.

25:41.820 --> 25:42.860
From the bow.

25:42.860 --> 25:44.940
The form is 144 feet tall.

25:44.940 --> 25:45.420
Right.

25:45.420 --> 25:48.700
As we're hitting to see the waves broke all the way over.

25:48.700 --> 25:49.980
I better keep my hands down.

25:49.980 --> 25:51.020
That's okay.

25:51.020 --> 25:52.060
My life will get me.

25:52.060 --> 25:57.100
You had an assignment to take some elements of the night

25:57.740 --> 26:00.860
from your back to the Pacific for the staging of the groundwork.

26:00.860 --> 26:01.420
Yeah.

26:01.420 --> 26:02.620
That was from Marseille.

26:02.620 --> 26:03.260
Right.

26:03.260 --> 26:06.140
But while you were in the Atlantic, you got word

26:06.140 --> 26:09.100
that the bomb had been dropped in Japan and that the war was.

26:09.660 --> 26:12.860
Was over in Japan and you were in the right place for that.

26:12.860 --> 26:13.900
I don't know about that.

26:13.900 --> 26:18.060
Well, we all loaded these troops to take them

26:18.700 --> 26:19.740
back through the Panama

26:20.700 --> 26:23.980
to probably the Philippines.

26:23.980 --> 26:25.260
We were unclear on that.

26:25.260 --> 26:25.500
Right.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.260
For staging to invade Japan.

26:27.900 --> 26:30.860
The war was over in Japan and someone that

26:30.860 --> 26:33.740
Pentagon made the decision that all those ships

26:34.380 --> 26:36.460
transporting troops that had already transit

26:36.940 --> 26:40.700
passed through the Panama would continue to their destination.

26:41.260 --> 26:45.100
Those who had not us, we were diverted to New York City

26:45.820 --> 26:47.580
and talk about happy people.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.740
When we passed the word,

26:49.740 --> 26:51.740
that ship brought not from seas,

26:52.380 --> 26:53.900
but from happy soldiers.

26:53.900 --> 26:54.860
That's right.

26:54.860 --> 26:56.060
And I don't blame them.

26:56.060 --> 26:58.540
And they broke out all sorts of stuff you drink.

26:58.540 --> 26:59.820
I don't know what it was.

26:59.820 --> 27:00.940
Or where they had it.

27:00.940 --> 27:04.300
Because they all of a sudden their course just changed to New York City

27:04.300 --> 27:06.060
instead of going to get ready.

27:06.060 --> 27:06.860
To invade Japan.

27:06.860 --> 27:07.500
For a ground war.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.060
Yeah.

27:08.060 --> 27:08.300
Yeah.

27:08.300 --> 27:09.820
No wonder that they were happy.

27:10.540 --> 27:13.340
You were actually on the ship until 1946.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.980
We'll be long after the war because there was a lot more

27:15.980 --> 27:17.100
transporting to be done.

27:17.100 --> 27:17.980
To bring people back.

27:17.980 --> 27:19.180
To bring people back.

27:19.180 --> 27:21.580
On one of the trips through the Suez,

27:21.580 --> 27:24.860
we went both to what is now Pakistan

27:24.860 --> 27:28.060
and what is badger if we should read about a lot

27:28.060 --> 27:29.500
in our war in Iraq.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.620
Up to Persian Gulf to pick up troops.

27:32.620 --> 27:35.740
I started talking to guys, you know Jim Baylor-Syes.

27:35.820 --> 27:40.060
That was my brother who I'm not seeing for over three years.

27:40.060 --> 27:44.060
And he had left Badgers for three weeks before I got there.

27:44.060 --> 27:47.500
Otherwise I would have had the chance to bring him home.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.220
But I did not.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.300
We're running short on time.

27:50.300 --> 27:55.180
So you finished in in in in 46, like I say in the summer of 1946

27:55.180 --> 27:57.100
is when you got off off the ship.

27:57.100 --> 28:01.260
And you enrolled came back you enrolled in Arkansas at Fayetteville

28:01.260 --> 28:02.460
in the fall of 46.

28:02.700 --> 28:04.380
Started business administration.

28:04.380 --> 28:08.140
You like me didn't thank very too much of accounting

28:08.140 --> 28:09.020
and taking staff.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.220
Well they didn't think much of me.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.820
We used to call it then running play with BBA.

28:14.620 --> 28:15.980
They both drove me crazy.

28:15.980 --> 28:17.420
So I went back to the sciences.

28:17.420 --> 28:18.620
I started as a pre-made.

28:18.620 --> 28:19.180
Right.

28:19.180 --> 28:21.420
And got my back from Swalajian chemistry.

28:21.420 --> 28:21.900
Right.

28:21.900 --> 28:22.940
It's all year in the fall.

28:22.940 --> 28:23.660
Talk of excuse.

28:23.660 --> 28:24.460
Dermot Arkansas.

28:24.460 --> 28:25.820
The most orange takes it.

28:25.820 --> 28:26.700
Seventh grade.

28:26.700 --> 28:28.700
You know, seven through twelve.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.140
Yeah, you said that's when you lost your year.

28:30.140 --> 28:32.060
Seven different preparations every day.

28:32.940 --> 28:35.020
And then the orange work for DuPont.

28:35.020 --> 28:36.220
That's where Mary and I met.

28:36.220 --> 28:38.220
I decided to go to graduate school

28:38.220 --> 28:40.380
in the University of Texas in history.

28:40.380 --> 28:41.020
You're in Mary.

28:41.020 --> 28:41.820
Big switch.

28:41.820 --> 28:42.300
You're in Mary.

28:42.300 --> 28:43.820
We're married in 1950.

28:43.820 --> 28:45.980
You bet you switched from the sciences from business

28:45.980 --> 28:48.300
administration to the sciences to history.

28:48.300 --> 28:50.380
And that took you to the citadel for one year.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.500
When it was a great experience.

28:51.500 --> 28:56.140
Your first son David was born there in the citadel.

28:56.140 --> 28:58.460
And but you were there for only one year.

28:58.460 --> 29:01.820
And you had heard about Texas A&M

29:01.900 --> 29:05.100
from a professor that you had worked with at the University of Texas.

29:05.100 --> 29:05.600
Yes.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.660
Ralph Steen, who's head of department at A&M,

29:07.660 --> 29:09.340
was a visiting property UT.

29:09.340 --> 29:09.740
Right.

29:09.740 --> 29:11.900
Not having class got to knowing.

29:11.900 --> 29:14.780
He called me once I got to the citadel.

29:14.780 --> 29:20.220
And in 55, the legislature passed the law requiring all graduates.

29:20.220 --> 29:23.180
A public universe have six hours of American history.

29:23.180 --> 29:25.100
Six hours of polysci or government.

29:25.100 --> 29:26.500
What did he want to call it?

29:26.500 --> 29:29.740
He called me and said, they give me special money to hire five people.

29:29.820 --> 29:32.540
If you ever think you're coming, it's now.

29:32.540 --> 29:33.540
So I did.

29:33.540 --> 29:37.260
Regrated leaving after only one year at the citadel.

29:37.260 --> 29:40.060
But I did not think I could pass up the opportunity.

29:40.060 --> 29:42.060
You talked about how at the citadel, it was all military.

29:42.060 --> 29:42.900
Oh, no.

29:42.900 --> 29:46.060
You yourself were in uniform as you taught classes there.

29:46.060 --> 29:51.820
But then you came to A&M in 1956 and spent 34 years

29:51.820 --> 29:53.860
in the history department.

29:53.860 --> 29:57.740
We could do a whole other show just on your time at A&M.

29:57.740 --> 29:59.780
So A&M, but that was during a time.

29:59.780 --> 30:04.580
I know you knew General Rutter quite well as a fellow military men.

30:04.580 --> 30:06.300
I had his order in class.

30:06.300 --> 30:08.660
When you came, Bear Bryant was the head football coach.

30:08.660 --> 30:16.420
And so 34 years at Texas A&M and retired in 1986 from full time, 1919.

30:16.420 --> 30:17.420
1990.

30:17.420 --> 30:18.420
The second time.

30:18.420 --> 30:19.420
For real.

30:19.420 --> 30:20.420
Right.

30:20.420 --> 30:23.260
That four years I told each fall semester during the football season.

30:23.260 --> 30:24.260
Right.

30:24.260 --> 30:25.260
Right.

30:25.260 --> 30:26.260
It's part time.

30:26.260 --> 30:27.260
We're out of time.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.260
Thank you.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.260
Appreciate it.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.260
He enjoyed doing it.

30:30.260 --> 30:31.260
It was fun.

30:31.260 --> 30:32.260
Enjoyed it.

30:32.260 --> 30:34.900
Garland Bayless and his wife, Mary, were married in 1950.

30:34.900 --> 30:39.540
And they have three sons, David, Fred, and Mark, and eight grandchildren.

30:39.540 --> 30:43.420
He speaks proudly of his opportunity to serve 30 years as a sailor.

30:43.420 --> 30:45.900
And we honor him and salute him for that service.

30:45.900 --> 30:47.380
I'm Tom Turbivill.

30:47.380 --> 30:49.620
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.

30:57.260 --> 30:58.260
Thank you.

30:58.260 --> 30:59.260
Thank you.
