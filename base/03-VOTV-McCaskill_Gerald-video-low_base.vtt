00:30.000 --> 00:38.280
Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley. I'm Tom Turbavill. When Gerald

00:38.280 --> 00:43.360
McCaskill boarded the battleship USS Tennessee in June of 1944 it was the

00:43.360 --> 00:47.560
first ship that he had ever seen. He would see plenty of it over the next 15

00:47.560 --> 00:51.720
months including combat action throughout World War II's Pacific theater.

00:51.720 --> 00:57.040
The Tennessee had already seen plenty of warfare including on 7 December

00:57.040 --> 01:02.440
1941 Dr. Pearl Harbor alongside the ill-fated West Virginia and Arizona on

01:02.440 --> 01:07.800
that day that will live in infamy. Over his time on the Tennessee its travels

01:07.800 --> 01:14.200
took it to Saipan, Guam, Tinian, Gualcanala, Pei-Lut, the Philippines, back to

01:14.200 --> 01:18.360
Pearl Harbor, Saipan and within a mile of the beaches of Iwojima for that

01:18.360 --> 01:23.200
marine invasion to Mount Sarabachi. On Okinawa and eventually to Japan the

01:23.200 --> 01:27.040
Tennessee was badly damaged at least twice after the attack on Pearl

01:27.040 --> 01:31.240
Harbor and attack at Tinian later a suicide attack to the quarter-deck.

01:31.240 --> 01:35.720
Gerald McCaskill has a story to tell and we are proud to welcome him to

01:35.720 --> 01:39.200
Veterans of the Valley. Gerald it is an honor to have you here on Veterans of the

01:39.200 --> 01:42.520
Valley and again thank you for your service. I want to move you right out of

01:42.520 --> 01:45.880
high school you went to centerville high school and it was either stay and do

01:45.880 --> 01:51.040
farming with your dad get a job or do what the inevitable was and that was

01:51.040 --> 01:53.440
going to the service you knew you were going to get drafted so you joined the

01:53.440 --> 01:58.160
Navy. Talk about that and you had a very quick training before you went on to

01:58.160 --> 02:07.080
the Pacific. I did. I had just a menial job after I got out of high school with

02:07.080 --> 02:17.800
a geophysical crew and knew that eventually I would be drafted and at that time

02:17.800 --> 02:26.800
you could make a choice as to what branch of the service you want to be in and

02:26.800 --> 02:36.000
I thought maybe the Navy might be okay because you know it was dry and not much

02:36.000 --> 02:45.520
mud on the ship and so forth but anyway I went in March 14 I believe in 1944 and

02:45.520 --> 02:55.680
was sent to San Diego, California for my training and normally you have about

02:55.680 --> 03:04.240
three months of boot camp but we had six weeks and never knew why except we had

03:04.240 --> 03:12.880
after our boot camp we had one week of work detail which was entailed

03:12.920 --> 03:19.240
stenciling clothes for the new recruits and of course we having been in six weeks

03:19.240 --> 03:25.720
we thought we were pretty big fellows because we did a lot of shouting at them

03:25.720 --> 03:35.240
and so forth but anyway after that we boarded a troop transport and went to Hawaii

03:35.240 --> 03:42.680
and we were aboard I don't remember the name of the old troop transport but

03:42.680 --> 03:50.240
once we got to Hawaii they mustered us around on the island and we were there

03:50.240 --> 03:56.160
about three or four days before they made assignments and there was quite a

03:56.160 --> 04:02.960
few sailors in the group and most of them were all brand new recruits so they

04:02.960 --> 04:08.320
divided them up among the ships needed help and it so happened that I got

04:08.320 --> 04:16.600
the Tennessee which as it turned out I was happy that I did but what was your job?

04:16.600 --> 04:29.120
Well during battle I was then damaged control which was a matter of when we

04:29.120 --> 04:37.920
had damage to the ship in the lines or decking or whatever we tried to stop

04:37.920 --> 04:44.200
the flow of water or oil or whatever was in the compartment until they could

04:44.200 --> 04:52.840
get some of the specialists to come and repair it and I remember of course

04:52.840 --> 05:00.920
SIPAN was where we got hit and we one of the shells hit one of the five inch

05:00.920 --> 05:08.760
batteries and killed everybody in here and then another one hit just above the

05:08.760 --> 05:15.520
water line and one hit on the quarter deck above our compartment where our

05:15.520 --> 05:24.320
battle station was and it just so happened that it hit the Spud Locker where

05:24.320 --> 05:31.720
the potatoes stored the potatoes and also broke a salt water line and our

05:31.720 --> 05:37.760
compartment was filled it up pretty fast with potatoes and water so we got

05:37.760 --> 05:44.360
the water stopped and of course then our duty was pretty much over as far as

05:44.360 --> 05:52.840
that was concerned and nobody in our compartment was hurt or injured

05:52.840 --> 06:04.440
anyway in that campaign but I think we lost seven died in about 25 or six injured

06:04.440 --> 06:08.560
the ones that died were the ones that were around that five inch in that five inch

06:08.560 --> 06:15.320
mount and that five inch mount gone yeah right and excuse me I'm not sure how many

06:15.320 --> 06:23.160
people what the complement was was a five inch but anyway they were killed

06:23.160 --> 06:31.360
instantly and the mount was on fire and about how many sailors were on the

06:31.360 --> 06:36.840
Tennessee at this time we had about almost two thousand wow that's officers man

06:36.840 --> 06:48.480
and cooks so it's like a small town yes and we had a barber shop and of course

06:48.480 --> 06:56.880
which they didn't have to be specialists to be barbers and maybe but we had a

06:56.880 --> 07:02.680
commissary where you could requisition clothes or supplies or whatever and

07:02.680 --> 07:10.440
get sometimes it have candy and and we had a ice cream maker that you could get

07:10.440 --> 07:15.920
a little ice cream occasionally but most generally you just took the child

07:15.920 --> 07:23.460
that they gave you and when I first went aboard and before they assigned me to a

07:23.460 --> 07:32.320
division or a group I was just hanging loose and I had to sleep in my hammock

07:32.320 --> 07:42.800
in the mess hall which wasn't a great deal of fun but we got to wake up because the

07:42.800 --> 07:52.360
cooks come in and they start hollering at your turn over your hammock and after that I got of course

07:52.360 --> 08:00.720
I got assigned to the art division which was one of the biggest groups of men on the ship

08:00.720 --> 08:09.840
and like I say they had chip bitters and pipe bitters and carpenter's and metal

08:09.840 --> 08:20.040
workers and we had we even had the band was an art division wow did you you'd only

08:20.040 --> 08:25.400
been in the Navy three months this first attack happened you've been on the ship

08:25.400 --> 08:31.680
probably less than a month I guess what did you think I mean had you had you

08:31.680 --> 08:37.720
envisioned that the action was going to start up that quick well no before I got

08:37.720 --> 08:47.960
before we left Pearl Harbor to go to the Mariana's I was a friend of mine from New

08:47.960 --> 08:55.840
York and I were just hanging out and we didn't know they were going to have gunnery practice

08:55.840 --> 09:05.360
but all of a sudden those 14-inch guns started firing and we didn't know what to do except

09:05.360 --> 09:15.040
we had trying to find a place to go and but it was overwhelming for me not having had any

09:15.040 --> 09:23.540
experience or not actually knowing anything about what was going on as far as being a

09:23.540 --> 09:30.400
border ship right right you tell me about a later on as we move on you tell me about a

09:30.400 --> 09:36.920
situation involving Admiral Halsey being used as a decoy well that was in the Philippines

09:36.920 --> 09:45.720
later on in the Philippines right yeah we had already you know landed and the ships were

09:45.720 --> 09:55.120
patrolling the Philippines and the East China Sea and the seventh division which was what we

09:55.120 --> 10:09.440
were in had six old battleships and the second division second fleet had all the new ones you

10:09.440 --> 10:21.400
know they were swithered faster and had bigger guns and and that was Halsey's command right well

10:21.400 --> 10:37.000
there was as I understand it from reading now there was a kind of a build up of the Japanese fleet

10:37.000 --> 10:47.960
to come back to the Philippines and retake what they had lost and there was rumor I assumed that

10:47.960 --> 10:57.000
they got intelligence that the fleet was north and so Halsey wanted to score a big hit and he took

10:57.000 --> 11:05.320
all the big ships the new ship and the carriers and so forth and headed north to intercept them which

11:05.320 --> 11:16.760
left us there at the Philippines right well while that was exactly what Japanese wanted to do they

11:16.760 --> 11:30.600
wanted to get the Halsey out of the way and we were under the command of Olandorf and we got our

11:30.600 --> 11:38.600
assume we had intelligence that told us that the fleet Japanese fleet was coming through Surgao

11:38.600 --> 11:50.360
Straits and so he or somebody designed a plan whereby the ship would intercept these Japanese

11:50.360 --> 12:04.840
fleet coming in this narrow straight and the first group that attacked them was the PT boats and

12:04.840 --> 12:12.760
then they come on down and the destroyers started peppering them and by then our ships the

12:12.760 --> 12:22.040
battleships were stationed across crossways so that we could fire all of our guns the Japanese

12:22.040 --> 12:28.520
coming straight ahead could only fire their forward guns so we had them at a disadvantage and

12:28.520 --> 12:35.720
didn't take too long for them to turn tail and get out of there well of course when they turn

12:39.720 --> 12:48.360
we got after them again pretty good but I think the California was one of our ships I don't think

12:48.360 --> 12:54.040
she got a shot off. I don't know that but we've got a picture coming I was a matter of fact

12:54.040 --> 12:59.000
that's going to show both the Tennessee and the California in just a minute I want to fast forward

12:59.000 --> 13:04.600
here a little bit the battleship Tennessee had to go back to Seattle for its major repairs after

13:04.600 --> 13:09.320
the after the attack and you got to go home to what you hoped it'd been 30 days but it turned out not

13:09.320 --> 13:13.320
to be 30 days you were called back called back earlier but you were able to make your way back to

13:13.320 --> 13:20.680
Cedar Bill right? I would add yeah we moved into or we came to Bremerton, Washington which is

13:20.680 --> 13:30.360
across the bay from Seattle and they gave two leaves we were there to be there 60 days and they

13:30.360 --> 13:39.720
issued orders for two leave groups and of course not having had much time in the Navy I was able to

13:40.520 --> 13:48.280
secure one of the last leaves so you got to go home for 30 days? I got to go home for 30 days

13:48.280 --> 13:53.240
but it wasn't quite 30 days and you were called back. No they they were artists and of course I left

13:53.240 --> 14:02.760
way out in the country and they wired a center veil right and I had an uncle live in there and he

14:02.760 --> 14:08.760
got the telegram and brought it out to us and so I headed back and headed back back on the

14:08.760 --> 14:14.200
Tennessee to the Philippines patrolling the East China Sea and then eventually to Iwo Jima.

14:14.200 --> 14:22.600
He was Jima. For the to tell us a little bit about the Tennessee's role in the attack on Iwo

14:22.600 --> 14:27.240
Jima obviously you were offshore and you were providing cover for the Marines right? Well that's true

14:27.960 --> 14:36.520
and that was our basic program in any of the invasions. Normally we went in about five days

14:37.160 --> 14:46.840
in advance of the landings to fire and they had spotter planes that would detect and direct

14:47.320 --> 14:58.360
fire into the gun mounts and so forth and so we would stand off we would usually

14:58.360 --> 15:07.720
with fire for an hour from the starboard side then which swing around and fire from the port side

15:07.720 --> 15:13.560
and we had two crews at the port and starboard crew and they'd get to rest a little while.

15:14.520 --> 15:18.040
I want to go ahead and go to the pictures now because I wanted to just mention your

15:18.040 --> 15:22.440
your service at Iwo Jima because we have some photographs let's go ahead and go to those about

15:22.440 --> 15:30.040
how old were you in this picture? 18. 18. So this is the... By the time I started... Well actually you

15:30.040 --> 15:34.600
finished high school at 16 so you'd been in the service for a while right? Well I on my

15:35.160 --> 15:46.360
year before my 18th birthday I had been at Sopin, Guam, Tinian, Pellu, Philippines and the battle

15:46.360 --> 15:50.600
surrogous Drake. So you were an experienced sailor here? Yeah and you know you come back and you've

15:50.600 --> 15:56.440
got to ribbon with all the damn stars and people said what's up how do we do you boy?

15:59.080 --> 16:03.800
And you were proud to explain what those roll about. There's the the Tennessee right there now

16:03.800 --> 16:11.000
this is a photograph taken in July of 19 or actually this was off port Angeloos, Washington.

16:11.800 --> 16:15.880
Before you had boarded there this is sort of the early version before Pearl Harbor but I just

16:15.880 --> 16:20.920
thought that was an excellent photograph that was taken from a book that you have called USS

16:20.920 --> 16:26.200
Tennessee in World War II by Clifton Simmons and we the photograph you're about to see are all

16:26.200 --> 16:33.320
coming from that that book. This is another photograph sort of up close the Case Matte deck and

16:33.320 --> 16:38.760
the three inch guns but that's sort of an early version it didn't look quite like that right?

16:38.760 --> 16:45.960
The five inch guns excuse me. Well it did not look like that when I went aboard. Right it had more

16:45.960 --> 16:54.760
in close superstructure. That was early on. Yeah. Now we're going to move to Pearl Harbor. Right this is

16:56.200 --> 17:02.200
December 10th three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor and what you're seeing there is the

17:02.200 --> 17:09.160
Tennessee right beside the remains of the Sunk and West Virginia and this photo was taken from

17:09.160 --> 17:15.960
the hall of the Oklahoma. So and again this was before you had boarded but this is the this is the

17:15.960 --> 17:23.960
battleship that you would board and spend 15 months on. Yeah right. Okay we'll go into the next one.

17:23.960 --> 17:30.440
This is fresh from the rebuild after after Pearl Harbor. Well if you notice Tom on on

17:31.880 --> 17:40.440
about midway down there's some what we call blisters. Those were added. Right right afterwards.

17:41.080 --> 17:45.640
It's amazing after the attack on Pearl Harbor it was it was up and going and repaired in about

17:45.640 --> 17:53.320
three much time or less than three much time. This next photograph is a fascinating photograph. June

17:53.320 --> 17:59.880
18th 1944 you are now on the ship on the fire at Sipan. Right. And this photograph I was referring to

17:59.880 --> 18:04.440
I think this is the Tennessee and the foreground and in the background on the right that is that's

18:04.440 --> 18:12.520
the California. Uh huh. California and Tennessee were sisters ship. I see. In the same place.

18:12.520 --> 18:20.680
They were laid down at about the same time. I think they were completed in 1920. I'm not sure.

18:21.320 --> 18:28.680
Is that one Emmits? And this was on 17 October 1944. I bet you can you can recall when he came on board

18:28.680 --> 18:35.240
to address the. Yeah in fact the captain that's our captain on the left. I don't recognize it was

18:35.240 --> 18:43.000
otherwise. But that was but that was a quite a time when the oh well yeah you know the leader

18:43.560 --> 18:50.200
when the leader was there the main man. It didn't particularly want to have the ad on your ship.

18:50.680 --> 18:55.960
Because you had to had to tow the mark a little. Oh I bet you're doing a lot of scrubbing. We

18:55.960 --> 19:02.120
were flagship up here several times. A lot of cleanup before before he came. Yeah and you know

19:03.160 --> 19:11.480
of course most of those guys were just regular people. Exactly folks and um exactly. This is at

19:11.480 --> 19:18.280
Iwo Jima. The date is uh 19 February 1945 is I guess the Tennessee is positioning itself.

19:19.000 --> 19:25.080
Yeah and you well you can see that those are probably LCTs or

19:27.560 --> 19:34.040
going in I would guess. We've had veterans that were actually at Iwo's a veteran who actually

19:34.040 --> 19:40.280
was a Marine that was there at D day at Iwo Jima and he remembers looking out onto the waters and

19:40.280 --> 19:46.120
said I've never seen so many uh crafts in his whole life. So many ships and boats and cruisers and

19:46.120 --> 19:55.000
destroyers and uh and the Tennessee was one of them. Yep. This photograph in the next winter

19:55.000 --> 20:03.400
fascinating we have not talked yet about about this we will in 1945. The next major attack to the

20:03.400 --> 20:10.440
Tennessee was a suicide plane that found its mark and these first two photographs on the left of

20:10.600 --> 20:18.120
the right. This is just seconds before the suicide plane hit at the quarter neck and that's the

20:18.120 --> 20:24.040
moment of impact right there of the suicide plane hitting the Tennessee and in a moment we're

20:24.040 --> 20:29.640
going to get you to talk about that because this uh this came in April the 12th 1945

20:31.640 --> 20:37.080
and uh those pictures were actually still shot so taken from a film and finally I talk about uh

20:37.080 --> 20:42.440
you're on the bottom left and talk about this picture and well these were some guys that I

20:42.440 --> 20:51.880
worked with in the first lieutenant's office and the damage control group the kid on the right

20:51.880 --> 21:01.560
was from Naked Oches his name was Cyril Roberts and Don Hampton on the left back and Joe Martinez

21:02.200 --> 21:09.560
he was from New Orleans right and I I never heard from any of them I asked what I know that

21:09.560 --> 21:16.840
Martinez is dead and I would guess that Hampton uh probably he was older right but the

21:17.720 --> 21:26.840
guy from Naked Oches I finally tracked him down really really but he had uh had uh multiple strokes

21:26.840 --> 21:34.840
and I talked to his wife and uh and wrote him a letter and sent him this picture and she said well

21:34.840 --> 21:40.920
he smiled that's wonderful that's wonderful that's great matter of fact you just returned from a

21:41.640 --> 21:46.760
from a reunion in South Dakota that I know that you were very excited about you have a reunion

21:46.760 --> 21:52.440
every year yeah folks get together uh we've got about 85 including spouses right that's right and

21:52.760 --> 22:00.120
uh South Dakota doesn't seem like the appropriate place to have a ship reunion but

22:01.000 --> 22:06.520
what they try to do is is pass it around to different parts of the country so that

22:07.160 --> 22:14.360
guys don't have to travel as far every time right next year it's in Knoxville Tennessee

22:14.360 --> 22:20.760
I see and uh we saw the photographs and I want you to talk about April the 12th 1945 which also

22:20.760 --> 22:26.280
coincidentally happened to be the day that FDR died that's correct uh talk about uh we just have a

22:26.280 --> 22:30.600
few if you about five minutes left but I want you to talk about uh talk about that attack and

22:31.240 --> 22:38.840
how you all survived it because not everybody did well no the uh planes of course came in as uh from

22:40.200 --> 22:49.720
off the starboard bow the one that that uh hit us and I think we shot down four or five uh before

22:49.720 --> 22:58.600
they got that close but this one made it in and he hit the yard arm uh off the bridge and then

22:58.600 --> 23:07.240
tumble down and hit several of the open gun mounts and uh killed 26 I think that day

23:08.440 --> 23:18.920
and injured maybe 120 people but had a bomb and uh it hit on a quarter deck just above our

23:18.920 --> 23:27.800
compartment so we we had uh another didn't have any potatoes but we had a lot of damage we had

23:28.520 --> 23:36.360
as I remember we had some oil lines and we also had the water lines that we had to to take

23:36.360 --> 23:43.160
care of and nobody in our compartment was hit again so we were fortunate therefore you were

23:43.160 --> 23:47.640
discharged in April of 1946 we are running out of time so we're going to have to move forward but

23:47.640 --> 23:51.000
you did decide to come back rather than go to work at the farm came back and you went to

23:51.000 --> 23:54.920
Texas saying him it was kind of tough for you because you hadn't been to school for four years

23:54.920 --> 23:59.640
and it was it was kind of tough going but you all the side rather than go back to the farm to

23:59.640 --> 24:04.680
stick with it and you graduated in four years from Texas saying that I would be because I graduated

24:04.680 --> 24:14.280
in four years because I had to take 18 hours per semester to get all the uh credit in because my time

24:14.360 --> 24:22.440
GI bill would have run out right and I didn't have any money to go so yeah it uh to me the

24:22.440 --> 24:30.360
GI bill was one of the best things that they ever graduated from graduate from A&M in 1950 and that's

24:30.360 --> 24:35.160
the same year that you uh you married Shirley I sure did and uh I lucked out there and you lucked

24:35.160 --> 24:40.360
out there indeed and uh and then your your career took you uh to west Texas to the panhandle to

24:40.360 --> 24:45.160
Lubbock and eventually to Andrews where you were in the banking business for some 30 something years

24:45.160 --> 24:50.040
where you were you were kind of Mr Andrews I get the idea the president of the chamber of commerce

24:50.040 --> 24:57.080
and you know if you're in a small town and can't say no you get to do a lot of things but it did

24:57.080 --> 25:04.600
take up a lot of time but I enjoyed it right Andrews was probably one of the best small towns

25:05.240 --> 25:10.680
that we ever lived in. Herfberg would have been herfberg for a while and it was a good town.

25:10.680 --> 25:18.120
Right eventually you retired and you came back uh to to the area back to the Leon area but uh then

25:18.120 --> 25:21.880
because of health problems because of heart problems you wanted to get near some good doctors and

25:21.880 --> 25:27.560
that's sort of what brought you back to the town of your alma mater to college and uh we have a place

25:28.280 --> 25:34.920
up in the county that we needed to to look after and and at the time you know we had

25:35.720 --> 25:43.800
one of our sons lived in the woodlands right one lived in Georgetown and um the daughter lived in

25:43.800 --> 25:50.520
Denver and of course that was out of the picture so this was near and so we felt comfortable here

25:50.520 --> 25:57.240
and we're we this is another we've never lived in a place we didn't like we've always enjoyed

25:57.240 --> 26:03.960
ever where we've ever lived and college station is uh is a fine town. It needed is and we're glad

26:03.960 --> 26:09.080
to have you and surely have seven grandkids and one great grandchild one great and I know that

26:09.080 --> 26:13.880

26:13.880 --> 26:18.440
but I want to thank you very very much for your service the time goes goes very very quickly but

26:19.400 --> 26:23.320
I want to thank you for your service and in your retirement and college station I know you

26:23.320 --> 26:28.520
and surely you're enjoying it we are we we've done a lot of traveling indeed and he could

26:28.520 --> 26:33.640
plan to continue to do traveling out uh yeah along as the old wings stay vertical

26:35.400 --> 26:40.200
that's the idea thank you Gerald thank you for your service and thank you for being with us

26:41.320 --> 26:46.440
the stick with it attitude that Gerald McCaskill used to get through Texas A&M was certainly

26:46.440 --> 26:54.040
acquired by his brave service aboard the USS Tennessee from June 44 to September 45 BB-43 the

26:54.040 --> 26:59.240
Tennessee was certainly a proud ship that served from Pearl Harbor and beyond and Gerald McCaskill

26:59.240 --> 27:05.080
was later one of his proud sailors we salute Gerald McCaskill for his World War II service please
