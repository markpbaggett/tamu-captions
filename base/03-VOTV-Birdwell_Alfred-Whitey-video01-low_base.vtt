00:30.000 --> 00:42.160
Hello and welcome to Veteran to the Valley.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.000
I'm Tom Terbaville.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.440
Alfred Whitey Birdwell was a Sherman Tank driver in World War II's European theater.

00:49.440 --> 00:53.840
After D-Day, but during the final push in the Battle of the Bulge and until victory in

00:53.840 --> 00:54.840
Europe.

00:54.840 --> 00:59.760
He was overseas just more than a year, but probably covered more miles per day served than

00:59.760 --> 01:01.000
just about anyone.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.840
He proudly recalls when he drove the first American tank over the Ryan River for the

01:05.840 --> 01:09.280
third armored spearheads, a purple heart recipient.

01:09.280 --> 01:13.560
He drove a tank every day except for those ten days that he was laid up because of

01:13.560 --> 01:14.560
Shrapnel wounds.

01:14.560 --> 01:20.720
Now, 91 years old, he has another fascinating story of World War II service that we are

01:20.720 --> 01:21.720
honored to tell.

01:21.720 --> 01:22.720
So welcome.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.200
Whitey Birdwell to Veteran to the Valley.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.120
Whitey, it is a pleasure to have you.

01:27.120 --> 01:32.200
I got to meet you back on May 1st when we were honored to take the Lone Star Honor

01:32.200 --> 01:33.800
Flight trip to Washington.

01:33.800 --> 01:37.760
And that was a great trip that we've been able to review here on Veterans of the Valley.

01:37.760 --> 01:41.840
But we're here today to talk about your life and your service.

01:41.840 --> 01:42.840
You're a Texan.

01:42.840 --> 01:43.840
You grew up in Henderson.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.840
Absolutely.

01:44.840 --> 01:45.840
Absolutely.

01:45.840 --> 01:49.560
Sort of take us through, you know, from Henderson.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.960
And you worked for a while, but couldn't find steady work.

01:52.960 --> 01:59.960
So you said the day after you got laid off from a job, you got drafted, is that right?

01:59.960 --> 02:06.000
All I had were just neighborhood work until that time.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.880
And when the defense work started, we went down to Beaumont and went to work for Loomis

02:11.880 --> 02:16.880
Company where we were making beauty dying for the tires.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.280
And we built that plant there.

02:19.280 --> 02:25.640
And we finished it up on the day that I finished my job on the afternoon.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.280
And I got my draft card the next morning.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.680
So I went into Houston and they saw me in.

02:31.680 --> 02:36.480
And so I waited six weeks and then went down to Fort Sound, Houston and they put me in

02:36.480 --> 02:37.480
uniform.

02:37.480 --> 02:41.360
Well, you were married and had two kids at the time and you were only making about $1.10

02:41.360 --> 02:43.720
an hour at your job.

02:43.720 --> 02:47.040
So this was probably better for you to be in the Army.

02:47.040 --> 02:54.240
You went into the Army in March of 43, overseas to Europe January the first 1944 and a fascinating

02:54.240 --> 02:59.200
part of your family history is that you had five brothers and they all served in World

02:59.200 --> 03:00.200
War II.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.200
All six of you, right?

03:01.200 --> 03:02.200
Right.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.200
Served in World War II.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.200
And two, one other is still alive today.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.200
Yeah, right at three years.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.200
Three of you are still alive.

03:08.200 --> 03:14.480
My brother just served in North Africa and the one that was in the Navy is the baby brother.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.480
Right.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.480
Still leaving.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.320
And then you said in the opening you were a tank driver.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.280
That's what you were trained to do.

03:20.280 --> 03:24.600
You drove lead tank for a first-petune, the third-armored division and they're called the

03:24.600 --> 03:25.600
spearheads.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.600
Talk a little bit about the spearheads in that unit.

03:27.600 --> 03:33.680
Well, our job was to go through the German lines and cut them into and break their communications

03:33.680 --> 03:40.120
and the other truth for to come behind and clean up and that's what we did.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.120
Right.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.760
So that was the, they told us that when you get started, don't stop.

03:45.760 --> 03:50.280
Don't stop for anything because it's just like a wave of water in front of a car.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.040
When you stop and it laughs you back on this hard to start again.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.040
So drive through.

03:54.040 --> 03:55.040
Just keep driving.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.040
Just keep driving.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.040
Don't stop.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.040
You'll get stuck.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.280
When you get a move and move them.

03:59.280 --> 04:04.480
I'm always fascinated by veterans who did serve in the European theater about how they

04:04.480 --> 04:09.680
got there and you went aboard a converted luxury ship or passenger ship, the Queen Mary.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.160
Oh, the Queen Mary, yes.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.680
That's your deal.

04:12.680 --> 04:13.680
Yeah.

04:13.680 --> 04:18.440
I don't know how many truth food on it, but it was the wall to wall.

04:18.440 --> 04:25.600
And kind of hard eat that lamy cook and then drink the coffee and tea mixed together.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.600
We made it.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.600
Somehow you did it.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.040
You left for Boston Harbor and what had you wanted to take you a week?

04:32.040 --> 04:35.000
It took six days in England.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Right.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.320
You know, the seventh day it was in the Harv France.

04:39.320 --> 04:45.440
So you landed in England, you took the train down and actually took an LST across the channel

04:45.440 --> 04:47.640
and landed in Lahore, France.

04:47.640 --> 04:48.640
Yes.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.400
First you thought you were going to North Africa, is that right?

04:51.400 --> 04:54.000
No, they sit well in training.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.560
In training, but they didn't know how the war was moving.

04:57.560 --> 05:02.680
And so when they found out that North Africa was getting along just fine and they decided

05:02.680 --> 05:07.880
to send us over to Germany and just hit the heart of the Germans there in Germany and

05:07.880 --> 05:09.560
hit the glows of the gate on them.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.560
Right.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.960
Talk a little bit more about your mission and the service of your particular mission because

05:14.960 --> 05:20.040
you were in Lahore, France and your job like you said was to cut through the German

05:20.040 --> 05:23.720
lines and just sort of disrupt things and band them together.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.720
Talk a little bit more specifically about that.

05:25.720 --> 05:26.720
Well, I'll be just like that.

05:26.720 --> 05:27.720
Applying a field.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.120
When you drive through, the Germans go this way.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.120
Yes, sir.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.960
And then we had the fourth armoured on one side of us.

05:33.960 --> 05:39.200
Well, one now e-cup me on one side of us and another company on the other side and

05:39.200 --> 05:45.560
we just kind of plow them in together and then the rear-rashel armoured come along and

05:45.560 --> 05:47.720
pick them up and send them back to the prison camp.

05:47.720 --> 05:48.720
Right.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.560
So they were the ones that were more in charge of taking them as prisoner.

05:51.560 --> 05:55.520
You were the one that sort of banded them together and said, Mark's along.

05:55.520 --> 06:00.920
Well, the only time that we took prisoners is when they gave up on the front line.

06:00.920 --> 06:01.920
Right.

06:01.920 --> 06:05.200
They were guns and helmets and just sent them back down the road.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.200
Right.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.680
You said at the time that you did encounter resistance.

06:09.680 --> 06:10.680
Oh, yeah.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.960
But those who wanted to surrender gave up.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.960
They gave up.

06:15.960 --> 06:16.960
They weren't ready.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.480
They didn't want war anymore in themselves.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.480
Home guards.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.480
Yeah.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.240
There were people who were scripted in the army as home guards.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.240
Right.

06:24.240 --> 06:28.160
And the roughest one that we faced was the hip to youth and the SS.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.160
Right.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.480
That was the reference.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.480
Right.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.840
Those are the ones that you had to give resistance back to.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.040
Back to, yeah.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.040
Right.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.960
Because of, right.

06:41.960 --> 06:48.720
Talk about, oh, you talked about your tank and how you sort of camouflage your tank to

06:48.720 --> 06:52.320
keep the Germans from knowing exactly who you all were.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.920
You had a little bit of unique way of doing that.

06:55.920 --> 06:56.920
I don't know.

06:56.920 --> 07:03.760
We didn't do that so much as some of the other guys did who were in the holding position.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.760
We were moving.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.160
We didn't have time to do that.

07:06.160 --> 07:12.360
We just had to record our me color on it.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.360
Right.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.360
It was steel.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.360
The only time.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.360
Well, I had a piece of steel on the front of it.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.360
Right.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.360
That's what I meant.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.360
Yeah.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.360
That's what I was talking about.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.360
I got into the steel mill in Germany.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.360
I saw this piece of soft metal steel there.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.080
It was pretty thick and I asked the sergeant, I said, can you put that on the front of my

07:27.080 --> 07:29.320
tank to cover up that star?

07:29.320 --> 07:30.320
Uh-huh.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.600
He called the vehicle over there and picked it up well in the front of the tank.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.840
My tank run like a mad horse with a tail up in there with that heavy piece of metal

07:37.840 --> 07:38.840
in the front.

07:38.840 --> 07:39.840
Right.

07:39.840 --> 07:40.840
Right.

07:40.840 --> 07:44.320
It really did the job because they had a lot of gouges in it.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.320
Right.

07:45.320 --> 07:48.160
So now as a tank, you drove the tank.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.320
There were five in each tank, right?

07:49.320 --> 07:50.320
Five in each tank.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.320
Right.

07:51.320 --> 07:56.080
So did your entire brigade or your unit had about the fire power of 17 tanks, right?

07:56.080 --> 07:57.080
Well, yes.

07:57.080 --> 08:04.400
Because we had five tanks online and we had the Air Force observer and the artillery observer

08:04.400 --> 08:05.400
in the tank.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.040
So we had two extra tanks.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.040
Right.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.560
We had 17 and fire power.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.560
Right.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.800
You are a receiver of the Purple Heart.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.120
You did earn the Purple Heart.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.640
I guess if that's the word for it, I guess it's not something that people strive for.

08:18.640 --> 08:23.080
We were talking about the circumstances of your, of how you were wounded because you

08:23.080 --> 08:25.760
were trying to, you were trying to help a fellow soldier.

08:25.760 --> 08:32.600
Well, we were, they were sent up on the hill to observe and we got up there.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.600
We didn't see anything.

08:33.600 --> 08:40.840
Of course, of course, we took a field glasses and looked around and the sister driver got

08:40.840 --> 08:44.080
out to throw a hay on the tank to camouflage it.

08:44.080 --> 08:48.200
And that's when the mortar fire started coming in and good as arm off.

08:48.200 --> 08:53.120
And so he was just in limbo out there not knowing, you know, just crazy.

08:53.120 --> 09:00.280
When you get hit that way, the, I don't know how, well, you know, I don't know how you

09:00.280 --> 09:01.280
feel.

09:01.280 --> 09:04.880
I don't know how to explain it except he was just out there in La La Landland suffering.

09:04.880 --> 09:05.880
Right.

09:05.880 --> 09:10.400
So I jumped out the tank and hit him in the fox over there.

09:10.400 --> 09:14.400
So the mortar fire kept coming in and it was hit on the side and the ground was shaking

09:14.400 --> 09:17.760
as the next one is going to be in here on top of it and get both of us.

09:17.760 --> 09:22.440
So if I can get out and let them follow me with, it would save him.

09:22.440 --> 09:28.840
But when I jumped out, I was foot slipped on a, about your hay and I laid there and that's

09:28.840 --> 09:31.600
when the mortar fire hit me.

09:31.600 --> 09:35.200
And I tell everybody, I said, well, you know what you have going when I got shot because

09:35.200 --> 09:36.200
I got shot.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.240
But he just got me started and I got out there.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.880
129 pieces of shrapnel they took out of you, right?

09:42.880 --> 09:45.920
Put it in a little deer like that and I lost it somewhere.

09:45.920 --> 09:46.920
Yeah.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.240
And I was just doing it here.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.640
But you were, you were able to get up and go to see it.

09:52.640 --> 09:53.640
It didn't cripple me.

09:53.640 --> 09:54.640
It didn't cripple me.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.120
They just sent me to hospital in fetching.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.120
Right.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.080
And to get the shrapnel out that was there.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.080
Right.

10:01.080 --> 10:08.160
So they dug it out and popped it out and give me penicillin and I was all right after

10:08.160 --> 10:09.160
that.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.400
And you understand that the fellow that you, the soldier that you were trying to help,

10:12.400 --> 10:14.240
he was sent off to England, I guess.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.240
Yeah, he was in hospital.

10:15.240 --> 10:20.680
But he survived his wound as far as you know, but you never heard any more from him.

10:20.680 --> 10:21.680
Right.

10:21.680 --> 10:25.040
Well, he probably remembers the guy that jumped in the fox hole with him.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.480
I'm sure if he's alive today, I'm sure he remembers that.

10:27.480 --> 10:32.160
They call me Tex, so I remember.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.200
After your hospital now, you were sent back to work.

10:35.200 --> 10:40.840
You were in the hospital for nine to ten days and talk about after you were in the hospital,

10:40.840 --> 10:42.320
you wanted to go back to the front lines.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.320
I did go back to the right line.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.880
I'd say for space there was the front line.

10:45.880 --> 10:46.880
Exactly.

10:46.880 --> 10:51.560
So I went back and they were in Cologne and that's where I was wounded on the Cologne

10:51.560 --> 10:57.000
claims and they were in Cologne waiting for the bridge to be built because they were

10:57.000 --> 10:59.320
able to jump off again.

10:59.320 --> 11:04.320
So I went back and got old tank and drove the first one across the Rhine River.

11:04.320 --> 11:05.320
Talk about that.

11:05.320 --> 11:10.240
That's quite significant, I think, as the first tank to drive it was over a pontoon bridge.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.240
Well, right.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.240
Over the Rhine River.

11:12.240 --> 11:19.120
The pontoons were huge and my brother-in-law was there.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.720
I had to get a glimpse of him and I didn't get to talk to him because he was too busy.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.840
They just come and put a bridge and took off.

11:25.840 --> 11:30.880
They were huge pontoons and they tied them off on each side of the river because it was

11:30.880 --> 11:32.360
real swift.

11:32.360 --> 11:40.560
And then they tied them together with steel with pins and then they laid the track across

11:40.560 --> 11:42.560
them where it would work.

11:42.560 --> 11:47.340
And when I looked at that thing I said, well, I don't know, I'm going to leave my hatch

11:47.340 --> 11:49.120
off in case I go down.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.600
I could get out of this tank.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.880
But they were good, they supplied them real good.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.400
And so it would just go down and up, down and up.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.920
So we had to take our time and go across them and not really rush them, but just go with

12:02.920 --> 12:03.920
the flow.

12:03.920 --> 12:04.920
Right.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.160
And so we all trucks and all of them made it across.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.160
We were good.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.160
Right.

12:09.160 --> 12:14.800
It was a, it was Whitey Bird Wells Unit as a matter of fact that as we read that fired

12:14.800 --> 12:18.040
one of the first shells into Germany of the war.

12:18.040 --> 12:24.240
And the 110 mile march, you went back for, you went with those people, right?

12:24.240 --> 12:29.560
We went back, it was our time to go back for a rest and maintenance and a tank.

12:29.560 --> 12:34.880
And we went back a half a day when they told us we had to jump off because the 104th Infantry

12:34.880 --> 12:39.840
Division had the Germans had a giveaway and they followed them up.

12:39.840 --> 12:46.160
And they said, well, we got 110 miles to go before nightfall, get you.

12:46.160 --> 12:53.040
So we made it up to within about, I guess about 15 miles of the town.

12:53.040 --> 13:01.160
And when the Germans shot the third tank driver's head over the Pizzucco.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.840
And so that kind of disrupted the march.

13:02.840 --> 13:07.480
They just got together and decided, well, we got to have somebody in town to let the

13:07.480 --> 13:10.360
Germans know that we've arrived.

13:10.360 --> 13:15.640
And the diesel tank didn't have any exhaust flash from it with the radio tanks did.

13:15.640 --> 13:20.720
It was a burnt 90 out of 10 gas and it was a huge flame coming out of the exhaust light.

13:20.720 --> 13:26.720
So then I did the night duty anyway because they couldn't pick me up other than sound.

13:26.720 --> 13:33.560
So I followed the tanks sergeant in the town with the luminous button on his belt.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.640
And I just had to stay so close to him.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.760
We got into that town and I couldn't, I don't know how much further I could have went,

13:39.760 --> 13:44.000
but I don't think there are four of them because we were 110 miles and we were taking diesel

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
as a long way.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Right.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
And you were pretty much out of ammunition.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.680
Well out of ammunition and all that stuff.

13:50.680 --> 13:54.040
We couldn't have thought of a very good battle with what we had left.

13:54.040 --> 13:58.920
Anyway, the German heard us coming in and they started moving out.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.400
They didn't know you were out of ammunition.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.400
They just knew you were there.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.400
And now what you don't tell them?

14:02.400 --> 14:04.200
You never gonna tell them.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.360
So your job sort of switched.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.080
Your job was to support the infantry.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.520
But they were taking job all the way through with support to infantry.

14:10.520 --> 14:11.520
That's right.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.520
And with this strategy, they were taking care of you.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.520
That's right.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.520
They did.

14:15.520 --> 14:16.520
Yeah.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.320
They did a good job to it.

14:18.320 --> 14:22.120
The 104th grade that they never lost a tank and they didn't.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
Right.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.120
Right there with us.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.120
And you're glad because you're one of the tanks they didn't lose.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.120
I didn't think.

14:27.120 --> 14:35.800
Talk about how I've always been fascinated to ask people, you know, as a 22, 23 year old

14:35.800 --> 14:39.840
kid from Henderson, Texas.

14:39.840 --> 14:46.680
How did you feel having made the transition from being just a young Texas kid into warfare?

14:46.680 --> 14:51.040
I mean, you had to rely and trust on your training and off a lot.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.040
Right.

14:52.040 --> 14:56.560
And to start with, I was scared to death.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.560
Yes, sir.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.520
But you automatically do what the training is.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.720
It's something that has to kick in.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.120
So the training did.

15:05.120 --> 15:10.320
But I wasn't so fearful after I kind of got used to what was going on.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.320
Right.

15:11.320 --> 15:15.240
Because I was busy taking care of ourselves, you know, in the battle and whatever.

15:15.240 --> 15:20.760
And listening to the orders that, of course, you're captain, always trying to take care

15:20.760 --> 15:21.760
of you anyway.

15:21.760 --> 15:25.800
Because he was back observing what was going on.

15:25.800 --> 15:32.520
So when you don't realize when you're in basic training, how much the safety of it kicks

15:32.520 --> 15:33.920
in until you're there.

15:33.920 --> 15:34.920
Right.

15:34.920 --> 15:40.080
But it just automatically kicks in and you do the thing that you need to do to preserve

15:40.080 --> 15:41.600
yourself.

15:41.600 --> 15:46.880
You were in Europe for the better part, almost the entire part of the year of 1944, which

15:46.880 --> 15:52.560
is, you know, arguably the most significant year of the war as far as the European theater

15:52.560 --> 15:54.520
is concerned.

15:54.520 --> 16:00.200
You were during this, you were in this move through Germany.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.200
When D.D.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.000
occurred in June of 1944, you were there.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.440
Were you all getting any news or anything like that that there was an invasion and an

16:08.440 --> 16:14.680
Normandy that the decision had been made to make the final push and to defeat Hitler

16:14.680 --> 16:16.040
by making this final push.

16:16.040 --> 16:20.240
Were you all aware of sort of how the, what was happening in the war rooms?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.440
Well, we knew when Hitler killed himself.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.440
Right.

16:23.440 --> 16:29.720
And we were more or less brought up through not by news, but by word of mouth from here

16:29.720 --> 16:33.680
to there and the paper that they gave us.

16:33.680 --> 16:38.320
And so we kind of kept up on that all the way through.

16:38.320 --> 16:45.960
And we knew where the different units were because they were reported in the stars of

16:45.960 --> 16:46.960
stripes.

16:46.960 --> 16:47.960
Exactly.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.520
They let us know that we did have company over there.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.520
Right.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.520
Yeah.

16:52.520 --> 16:55.440
And so that gave us assurance that he put us out of the whole country.

16:55.440 --> 17:00.360
Winner of 1944, 45, that was in the Battle of the Bulge.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.840
And whenever I talk to anybody who served in the Battle of the Bulge, they talk about the

17:03.840 --> 17:04.840
weather.

17:04.840 --> 17:07.040
They talk about the cold.

17:07.040 --> 17:10.040
How do you, how do you describe it?

17:10.040 --> 17:17.000
Well, if he was at the North Pole, you would know it was terrific to tell you that we had

17:17.000 --> 17:18.640
our tanks eating the snow.

17:18.640 --> 17:19.640
Is that right?

17:19.640 --> 17:29.800
And well, I don't know other than say that we just had six to put a snow and you couldn't

17:29.800 --> 17:31.320
touch the tank with a bare hand.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.160
You had to stick to it.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.160
Right.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.480
And I don't know how we made out, but we did.

17:36.480 --> 17:39.480
We lived through it.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.560
We didn't have any casualties there.

17:42.560 --> 17:48.120
We knocked out one German tank that had come through lumber and through.

17:48.120 --> 17:53.480
And the first guy who was a tank sergeant called him pork, he said, oh, we're not going

17:53.480 --> 17:54.480
to do this.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.960
We're going to win the gets further down the line and we'll have more support.

17:57.960 --> 17:58.960
Right.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.160
But when he come down there, we put a white faucet on him.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.760
And they come out like blackwashed or for nests.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.920
So we didn't have any trouble with him.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.720
I'm just knocked out and burned.

18:09.720 --> 18:10.720
Right.

18:10.720 --> 18:14.760
Got three images I want to show you.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.000
Wadi bird well.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.880
This is your patch, which you have actually on the hat that you're wearing today too.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.880
There's a close up of it of the third Armored Division spearhead.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.320
That's the insignia.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.440
This is something that I came across that I found.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.040
It's a sketch, actually.

18:31.040 --> 18:35.040
And that is a major general rose in the top of that tank.

18:35.040 --> 18:41.920
And he was actually, this is a depiction of the time that through a misunderstanding that

18:41.920 --> 18:45.240
he was actually killed at this time.

18:45.240 --> 18:50.760
And this was a depiction actually of the moments just prior to his murder.

18:50.760 --> 18:54.480
And you speak of major general rose.

18:54.480 --> 19:02.920
And that's sort of a look of what the kind of tank that you had and that you were driving.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.560
And you say not many generals rodent tanks, right?

19:05.560 --> 19:06.560
That's right.

19:06.560 --> 19:07.560
They didn't.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.640
Well, they weren't in many generals on the line.

19:09.640 --> 19:10.640
Exactly.

19:10.640 --> 19:16.320
Because they were back in the direction, didn't direct in the army.

19:16.320 --> 19:19.960
And keeping up with casualties and all this.

19:19.960 --> 19:23.960
And they gave, of course, they gave the orders to marching orders.

19:23.960 --> 19:30.360
And this kind of thing, but they had a tremendous job to do to take care of everything other

19:30.360 --> 19:31.800
than just being on line.

19:31.800 --> 19:32.800
Right.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.600
There's another sketch in the back end of a Sherman tank.

19:36.600 --> 19:44.360
Of the type of tank that, quite a bird well, piloted.

19:44.360 --> 19:48.440
And some of the terrain was quite interesting, I guess, right?

19:48.440 --> 19:50.920
It stuck in the mud.

19:50.920 --> 20:01.680
Well, we were driving and we had some anti-aircraft guns up on the hill and we wanted to die

20:01.680 --> 20:05.240
so we got down low and going up by a valley.

20:05.240 --> 20:08.120
And, of course, I got in the quicksand and I went down.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.120
Right.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.880
So I had to stay there that night.

20:10.880 --> 20:15.400
And so for that anti-air tank fire for two or three hours.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.680
And some of the ifs we got hurt.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.680
Right.

20:18.800 --> 20:23.000
Something down deep enough that the water was coming in our tank.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.840
Tell me the story that you were telling me before we started today.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.840
The story that you forgot to tell me the other day.

20:27.840 --> 20:28.840
Oh, we were.

20:28.840 --> 20:33.080
And we carried our infantry up there, if we were the men's derisions.

20:33.080 --> 20:36.360
We went back to a little town called Sugartown.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.360
It was super stop.

20:38.360 --> 20:41.440
That's what they call it, villages with stops.

20:41.440 --> 20:45.840
And so we carried them up there and we were back, of course, in the holding position.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.960
We thought everything was over and clear back there.

20:49.960 --> 20:53.440
But one morning, I think about three days

20:53.440 --> 20:56.360
as we carried our infantry up, the Germans come in on this.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.360
Right.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.040
And I was in the tank at the time.

21:00.040 --> 21:04.480
But the captains driver come running up and said,

21:04.480 --> 21:06.440
Germans is in town.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.320
So I said, well, go wake the guys up.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.440
Not going to do it and holler help or something and just get them out of here.

21:12.440 --> 21:16.000
And I said, I'll take my rifle and play infantry.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.880
The grave guard was right across the street.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.840
And so I said, you can drive my tank.

21:19.840 --> 21:24.520
And I'll be out there and try to keep them all from you.

21:24.520 --> 21:28.240
So I got out there and fired one shot in my rifle, large.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.560
I said down there, the grave guard, they kicking up their dread.

21:30.560 --> 21:31.840
We didn't wait.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.280
It turned out real good.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.560
You know, because you're here talking to me.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.480
I'm here talking to you.

21:37.480 --> 21:41.720
They came by and I didn't know where the Germans were located.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.480
I knew that they were around that grave guard.

21:44.480 --> 21:48.200
So of course, they didn't come through the grave guard with my tank.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.560
And I didn't go across the fence.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.080
But anyway, they got down in the ways and they decided, well, we better come back.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.560
So they'd come back far in the machine.

21:55.560 --> 21:59.680
You know me and I got over the fence and followed the tank out.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.200
Everything turned out real good.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.000
We got it lasted about three or four hours.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
We got them all cleaned out.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.440
When the war in Europe ended, you came back into holding patterns.

22:10.440 --> 22:15.080
That came back through a rest camp and sort of talk about what you did.

22:15.080 --> 22:20.320
A lot of the soldiers and the military people were told immediately, well, you're going

22:20.320 --> 22:23.000
to put your own boats and we're going to go over to Japan because we're going to fight

22:23.000 --> 22:24.240
a ground war there.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.880
But that was not part of your mission.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.120
Talk about what your mission was.

22:28.120 --> 22:32.600
Our mission was just to set up military government to clean the towns and pick up the arms

22:32.600 --> 22:38.440
and ammunition that was left over and kind of establish a pattern of government for

22:38.440 --> 22:39.440
them.

22:39.440 --> 22:47.640
We got back from up there to an SS rest camp.

22:47.640 --> 22:51.480
I don't know where it was really.

22:51.480 --> 22:54.600
But anyway, it was a nice log encampment there.

22:54.600 --> 22:58.160
We stayed there three days and nights and got everything ready.

22:58.160 --> 23:03.760
And we were pulled back to Moorfell and brought it on the line and stayed there several

23:03.760 --> 23:07.240
weeks until we got down cleaned up.

23:07.240 --> 23:10.680
And then the military government took over and when they take over, we'd move out to

23:10.680 --> 23:16.000
another town and cleaned it up and let the military come in.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.080
We wound up the last place we were at was down in Swabish Hall, down in southern Germany.

23:21.080 --> 23:27.280
And that's where we broke up and they put us on their cattle cars just to up to the

23:27.280 --> 23:32.040
North Sea and put us on the boat and brought us on there.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.680
It made up a load.

23:33.680 --> 23:38.200
In January 12, 1945, so you were overseas just over a year.

23:38.200 --> 23:44.080
And you said you went probably in the years time, you probably traveled about as far as

23:44.080 --> 23:45.080
anybody.

23:45.080 --> 23:47.280
Is anybody possibly could in one year's time?

23:47.280 --> 23:49.880
Well, I didn't go through, of course, I would look.

23:49.880 --> 23:53.120
I didn't go through North Africa or didn't come through Italy.

23:53.120 --> 23:56.400
But I went all the way through French, Belgium and Germany.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.400
Exactly.

23:57.400 --> 24:01.200
And you came home, you had almost, they tried to leave you, right?

24:01.200 --> 24:04.160
When you were coming home, they told you there were a lot of...

24:04.160 --> 24:05.560
Well, we got back into...

24:05.560 --> 24:09.800
You asked Mark them.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.480
We went down to Pittsburgh.

24:12.480 --> 24:15.840
We tried to see everything we could see while we was on that trip, but we didn't figure

24:15.840 --> 24:19.480
that we would ever have an opportunity to go back.

24:19.480 --> 24:24.320
So we went down to Pittsburgh and got back into camp, but they'd already shipped out.

24:24.320 --> 24:27.680
So we just grabbed our bags and got on the train and it was coming to take us.

24:27.680 --> 24:28.680
Yep.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.800
And I was like, I'm going to have a little time, I could talk back to a girl.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.800
But you ended up getting back before the rest of it, right?

24:33.800 --> 24:34.800
You ended up getting back before the rest of it, right?

24:34.800 --> 24:35.800
Sure did.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.160
I got my dish jarring before the rest of the testing board.

24:38.160 --> 24:41.000
Yeah, they made room in the aisles for you to get home.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.160
You came home, you tried to get work and I looked this up because you made reference to

24:45.160 --> 24:48.320
it that you joined the 52-20 club.

24:48.320 --> 24:53.800
And I found out what that was and it says...

24:53.800 --> 25:00.480
At the time veterans were eligible to collect unemployment benefits for a period of one year,

25:00.480 --> 25:04.880
the amount paid was $20 a week for 52 weeks, hence the 52-20 club.

25:04.880 --> 25:09.680
At that time, $20 a week was a fairish amount of money and that would roughly equate to about

25:09.680 --> 25:12.160
$400 a week in today's dollars.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.200
That would be about pay for that.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.200
But it was rough finding work.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.200
There wasn't any.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.520
Coming back, there wasn't any.

25:18.520 --> 25:19.520
Wasn't any work.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.640
So you were a 52-20 guy.

25:21.640 --> 25:24.720
But eventually you did work and talked to sort of about what your career.

25:24.720 --> 25:27.480
I know you were in trucking, refinery business.

25:27.480 --> 25:32.720
Well, I started out driving a truck and that was a low-paying job but it was better than

25:32.720 --> 25:33.720
a farmhand.

25:33.720 --> 25:34.720
Right.

25:34.720 --> 25:39.880
And so I just went from there to construction work.

25:39.880 --> 25:43.520
And when they...

25:43.520 --> 25:50.680
Time began to change and of course the refineries were trying to build themselves up, you know,

25:50.680 --> 25:53.360
and in repair.

25:53.360 --> 25:57.480
Ford Becken Davis had a job going in the car behind and so I took off down to Texas City

25:57.480 --> 25:59.200
and went to work for Ford Becken Davis.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.200
Right.

26:00.200 --> 26:05.640
And I stayed down there for a number of years and work construction work.

26:05.640 --> 26:11.240
And I worked there and free for work.

26:11.240 --> 26:12.880
Galveston Houston.

26:12.880 --> 26:18.040
Then went to Chicago and worked there and I worked for it out there and wherever the

26:18.040 --> 26:19.040
work was.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.480
Who's house did you live in in Chicago?

26:21.480 --> 26:22.480
Paul Harvey's house.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.480
Paul Harvey's house.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.000
He actually owned the house that you lease, right?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
He owned the house, did I lease it?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
So he was your landlord.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
It was Paul Harvey.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.680
He was in California at the time.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.240
And that's the rest of the story there.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.240
Yeah.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.120
So he was in California at the time.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.120
That's right.

26:35.120 --> 26:40.320
You even talked about one time you actually lost a job indirectly because of Watergate.

26:40.320 --> 26:46.960
Well, I was in Phoenix working for Martin Construction.

26:46.960 --> 26:50.680
And the Martin...

26:50.680 --> 26:52.680
He was part of the Richard Nixon.

26:52.680 --> 26:57.520
Well, at one point in California, I think it was a representative of Shantan Center.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.640
And he was mixed up in the Watergate, but he had previously bought in with the Martin's

27:01.640 --> 27:03.640
of Phoenix.

27:03.640 --> 27:08.760
And so when this Watergate broke, we went out to job that morning and they said, clean

27:08.760 --> 27:09.760
up, boys, we're through.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.120
We're going to be out of here in eight hours.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.600
That's a tough way to lose a job.

27:13.600 --> 27:14.920
We're just about out of time, Wendy.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.640
And I want to thank you.

27:16.640 --> 27:19.400
Your first wife, Edith, died of cancer.

27:19.400 --> 27:24.000
But and you all had lost a child, but you had six children and you married Patsy in

27:24.000 --> 27:29.640
1965 and she had five children and together 11.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.120
And thank you for being with us.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.120
We appreciate it.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.120
Thank you for your service.

27:33.120 --> 27:36.480
I lived in a wonderful world of women.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.480
Lucky you.

27:37.480 --> 27:43.080
Wadi Birdwell and his wife, Patsy, were married in 1965 and between them 11 children.

27:43.080 --> 27:48.160
13 grandkids and 31 great grandkids and all can be justly proud of Wadi's service

27:48.160 --> 27:49.160
to our country.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.280
We salute him as we do all veterans.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.280
I'm Tom Turbaville.

27:52.280 --> 27:54.960
Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
