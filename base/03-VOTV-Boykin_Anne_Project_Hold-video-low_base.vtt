00:00.000 --> 00:12.520
In honor of the veterans who have served our country both past and present for a national

00:12.520 --> 00:18.640
bank, a Franklin Family Community Bank proudly sponsors veterans of the Valley.

00:18.640 --> 00:24.680
Since 1862, First National has provided local decision making and accessibility, as well

00:24.680 --> 00:28.160
as banking products and services to Bras's Valley citizens.

00:30.000 --> 00:58.860
8

00:58.860 --> 01:03.180
us on another edition of Veterans of the Valley. Today we're going to be doing something a bit different

01:03.180 --> 01:09.020
from our standard program. We will be talking about Project Hold. Project Hold is the City of

01:09.020 --> 01:16.140
College Stations Historic Online Library Database. They are archiving the history of College Station

01:16.140 --> 01:23.740
and the surrounding areas for everyone to access and enjoy at hold.cs.gov.

01:23.740 --> 01:29.180
With us today is Ann Boykin, Project Coordinator for Project Hold. And thank you for being with us.

01:29.180 --> 01:31.660
Thank you, Kyle, and thanks to Tom for letting us come in here.

01:32.380 --> 01:34.460
Give us a little bit of background on Project Hold.

01:35.340 --> 01:41.980
It started just a few years ago when we had done a series of oral histories and people decided

01:41.980 --> 01:46.940
that what are we going to do with it now? Where do we put it? And the City did not have the

01:46.940 --> 01:54.860
facilities or the funding to have a museum. So we already were using software to archive our

01:54.860 --> 01:59.340
standard documents within the city. So we're using that to put our documents online.

01:59.340 --> 02:03.980
So you just decided to make it digital and give access to everyone, which is a great idea.

02:03.980 --> 02:10.140
And even though we're more or less focusing on veterans and military type applications, Project Hold

02:10.140 --> 02:14.460
is far more reaching to that. It covers the broad spectrum of everything that's going on in our area.

02:14.460 --> 02:19.500
Everything. If you have a laundry ticket from 1934 or 1968, it might be interesting to us.

02:20.860 --> 02:24.780
We're open to anything and everything. The documents are daily life, especially.

02:24.780 --> 02:29.820
Right. You were kind enough to give us a pretty good broad spectrum of pictures that we're going

02:29.820 --> 02:33.900
to look at here. And a lot of these pictures, some of our viewers have already seen because those

02:33.900 --> 02:38.140
veterans have been on the show, but there's such good pictures we want to kind of re-show them again

02:38.140 --> 02:43.420
and let them see exactly what they're missing and what they find out by just going to your website.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.740
So let's go ahead and get to the pictures if we could.

02:45.740 --> 02:50.060
Great. Tell us what this picture is about. And obviously a lot of people should maybe be able to

02:50.060 --> 02:53.500
recognize this area. This is a parade downtown Brian. I'm sure you recognize a few of the

02:53.500 --> 02:59.580
buildings there on Main Street. And they were doing parades and kind of promotions to hopefully get

02:59.580 --> 03:03.980
more volunteers to go across the World War One. And I think we talked about this earlier from

03:03.980 --> 03:07.980
the perspective of where this picture was taken. Maybe this person would write about where the

03:08.060 --> 03:13.580
Palace Theater is now. I think so. Looking back towards that intersection right here. So this

03:13.580 --> 03:15.980
is probably Main Street and I can't remember what that cross street is.

03:17.180 --> 03:19.900
20 seconds. Yeah, I think it might be 26.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.140
26. Correct. Yeah. Around 1914.

03:22.140 --> 03:26.460
Oh, okay. And this is another one of the gatherings. This is a tank from World War One. Everybody

03:26.460 --> 03:32.140
standing appropriately far back from it. And the peak, the peak building and the right of your

03:32.140 --> 03:36.300
screen is a- Down the lower right. Yeah, lower right is the Aston building.

03:36.300 --> 03:40.300
Okay, so that should give everyone a perspective of where they were at there in downtown Brian.

03:40.300 --> 03:43.900
It doesn't look like a paved street to Main Street. It still looks like it's pretty much compressed

03:43.900 --> 03:51.740
dirt right now. Yeah. Okay, let's move on. Tell us who this is. This young man we don't have a name

03:51.740 --> 03:56.460
for. We'd like to have a name for him. If you recognize the photograph, it was just one that was

03:56.460 --> 04:00.860
in a group of photographs that we scanned in and we don't turn anything away. But I thought it

04:00.860 --> 04:05.580
was interesting just his uniform and that they were living in tents. I believe this is maybe North

04:05.580 --> 04:10.300
Africa. If anything, it also gives a shot of for the young people who watch the show. But this is

04:10.300 --> 04:14.460
how pictures kind of looked back in the days. They would put the little borders on them and dress them

04:14.460 --> 04:19.500
up a little bit. But if like Ann said, if anyone knows where this picture came from or who this

04:19.500 --> 04:23.340
gentleman is, feel free to contact. And I'm sure they'd like to put a name to a face.

04:25.820 --> 04:33.180
This is an honorable discharge for Luke Patronella from the Army and from after World War One.

04:33.260 --> 04:39.580
And I believe it's 1918. Okay. And if we go to the next document or the next picture,

04:39.580 --> 04:43.260
there's a little bit of a story between these two pictures. Yeah, he served in World War One and

04:43.260 --> 04:49.500
here he's listed on this listing of gentlemen who served in World War Two who did not make it back.

04:49.500 --> 04:56.620
And Luke Patronella died during World War Two. So he made it through WWI. Right. There are a number

04:57.100 --> 05:04.700
of names that are familiar around this area. Carava was one and I'm going to forget some of them

05:04.700 --> 05:10.380
already. But this was in a book that was given to us and it had documents veterans from Brasis County,

05:11.260 --> 05:15.900
Aggie veterans and African American veterans, which is a rare thing for us to have. Right. Okay.

05:16.860 --> 05:25.980
Speaking of. Yes. And this one is Mr. Thomas. He's also from Brian.

05:25.980 --> 05:29.980
He's also served World War Two. Okay. Do you know if his family is still here in the area?

05:29.980 --> 05:35.580
I believe they are. And this, that was Thomas Calhoun. This young man is Fred Barrell.

05:35.580 --> 05:42.380
And he's also from Brian and served in World War Two. This gentleman was fairly well decorated.

05:42.380 --> 05:46.620
And you would love to have some more history from the African American. This came from that

05:47.180 --> 05:49.900
yearbook that I was talking about. Right. Right.

05:50.140 --> 05:57.580
This gentleman is Alphonse Hardle sitting there in the jeep with the camera. And he had taken

05:57.580 --> 06:01.980
earlier, had taken some pictures of these German children. And it was interesting. And most of the

06:01.980 --> 06:06.380
soldiers, once they got to Germany, were able to buy cameras and start taking photographs. His

06:07.100 --> 06:10.860
son lives here and they gave us this photograph. That's a great picture of the German

06:10.860 --> 06:13.020
children sitting in the back of the American jeep. Yeah.

06:13.100 --> 06:23.500
This is Joe Bruce's group. They were, I believe, when they were in Germany,

06:23.500 --> 06:30.220
or flying over Germany, he was, they were hit and they had to jump out. And as if one

06:30.220 --> 06:36.060
and only John, he said, and ended up in a German POW camp. And he's the one kneeling in front.

06:36.060 --> 06:41.340
I believe a second from the right. Yes. Something like that. And he was a navigator. I believe

06:41.420 --> 06:49.980
on this plane and he's living here today. Okay. This is my dad. He's been on this. That's a

06:49.980 --> 06:54.860
strong German, isn't he? Put this in for fun. Occasionally they got leave and they got to do

06:54.860 --> 07:02.300
something fun. And he went on leave to not just standard army apparel. Not exactly. Not exactly.

07:02.300 --> 07:07.340
But we thought he looked cute. Every time I see this picture, I'm reminded of the old great

07:07.340 --> 07:11.980
movie Brigaduin. Yes. I've got to go rent that tonight just because I see somebody in the

07:11.980 --> 07:18.540
kilt. So, or for all you Braveheart fans. Cowboykin. He was a 14th tank destroyer battalion in the

07:18.540 --> 07:25.340
seventh armored division. That is a great, great picture. This is a sad little picture. This is

07:25.340 --> 07:31.100
a German child with a surrender flag. This was given to us by Bill Adams. And I believe he was

07:31.100 --> 07:36.700
the gentleman who took the photograph. That picture just speaks volumes. Yeah. It really does

07:36.700 --> 07:40.860
with just was just a little girl there in the white flag and the look on her face. If the people

07:40.860 --> 07:46.300
at home can see the look of this little girl's face, it really is. The anticipation and fear and

07:46.300 --> 07:50.780
happiness and everything all rolled into one. You can see in her face that there's a thousand

07:50.780 --> 07:54.700
different emotions going through her little mind right now. Exactly. Or when that picture was taken.

07:54.700 --> 07:58.540
I explained this to her. This is one of our more interesting pieces of memorabilia that we

07:58.540 --> 08:05.180
photographed in the office. Margaret Anthony, who lives here, brought this to us. Her father was in

08:05.180 --> 08:12.220
the CIC, the counterintelligence corps that was in Germany right at the beginning of the occupation.

08:12.860 --> 08:19.260
And this is a piece of the toilet from Hitler's private bath at Eaglesnest.

08:21.260 --> 08:25.340
Just one of your more unusual pieces of memorabilia that you don't see very often and we

08:25.340 --> 08:29.260
thought it'd be interesting to show. And just that piece of memorabilia is actually here in the

08:29.260 --> 08:38.620
Brasis family. Absolutely. Her father, Bernie McClurken, took quite a few photographs when they

08:38.620 --> 08:47.900
first entered Dachau. And this is one of the ovens. Right. Okay, next. This is a great picture.

08:47.900 --> 08:54.220
A great one. This is Kyle's favorite. This is the Normandy Invasion map. This was loaned us from

08:55.100 --> 09:04.140
Dr. Betloth. It was in his book recently. And that basically shows all the movements to the

09:04.140 --> 09:10.380
landing point. This is another one of Bernie McClurken's photographs entering Dachau.

09:12.860 --> 09:17.340
That had to be a strange feeling for those army guys to go into that place for the first time.

09:17.340 --> 09:23.580
Not no point was there. Very much so. And McClurken was instrumental in gathering information that

09:23.580 --> 09:28.620
brought a lot of the Nazi war criminals to trial. A lot of SS and the Gestapo.

09:29.500 --> 09:34.140
This is another great picture just because of the depth of field and it just let people know the

09:34.140 --> 09:39.340
perspective of where they were at. And you're looking way down into a valley. Way down into Oberama

09:39.340 --> 09:44.620
Gow. And these gentlemen Bernie McClurken is also in this photograph. They're on their way walking

09:44.620 --> 09:49.260
up to Eaglesnest. And he's the out of the three gentlemen. He's the one on the far left. Right.

09:49.340 --> 09:59.420
Right. This is Lieutenant Colonel Rudder who is I believe this was taken just immediately after

09:59.420 --> 10:04.220
the Normandy invasion. And surrounded by his troops and looks like they're kind of

10:05.020 --> 10:09.740
relaxing somewhat. So we think possible this was once they had ascended to the top of those

10:09.740 --> 10:13.900
cliffs. Yes. Yes. The kind of gathering and collecting themselves out of Madden. And that is

10:14.460 --> 10:17.580
I guess back then he was Colonel Rudder. And that's Lieutenant Colonel. Yes. Lieutenant Colonel

10:18.540 --> 10:25.020
he circled his head there. Rudder's Rangers. This is another photograph with the

10:25.020 --> 10:30.460
Bernie McClurken. They are walking up to the top of Eaglesnest and they're being escorted by

10:30.460 --> 10:36.460
the gentleman in the center an African-American who was Hitler's elevator operator. Wow.

10:36.460 --> 10:39.980
The very unusual photograph. But we don't know any of the names of these individuals.

10:40.940 --> 10:47.500
Okay. The Kuzlowski's are an interesting couple. They both served in the military and met

10:47.500 --> 10:51.900
towards the end of the war. They've been on the show before. They've been on the show. And she was

10:51.900 --> 10:56.700
a nurse. He was a pilot. And she's in this as almost like a mash. I think they had mash in World

10:56.700 --> 11:04.780
War II. But she's the nurse in the background of this surgical operation. Okay. And she's in the

11:04.780 --> 11:09.100
foreground here with her back to us offloading a patient from one of the planes.

11:10.620 --> 11:18.140
And she's here in this group of Russian soldiers. This has taken close to the Elp River.

11:18.140 --> 11:24.860
That's her in between the two Russians. Yeah. Very interesting photograph. That's a great picture.

11:27.500 --> 11:33.740
And this is her now husband Kuzlowski's shaving. I was thinking daily pictures. How do they

11:33.740 --> 11:39.740
manage? What do they do just shaving and getting dressed for the day? Do we know if they already

11:39.900 --> 11:44.060
met like when this picture was taken. Had he already met her? I think they met briefly at a dance

11:44.060 --> 11:47.820
early on. They never saw each other until at the end of the war where they got back together.

11:47.820 --> 11:52.860
I believe that's the story. Okay. But that's basically getting his morning shave. The best he can.

11:52.860 --> 11:59.980
Right. And here he is in the cockpit of C. I'm going to forget it. 21. C-47. Okay. Yeah.

12:01.180 --> 12:06.940
Given the Aggie thumbs up there. These are two local girls. Miss Landis and this how Dal. They

12:07.420 --> 12:14.300
are mailing female to Carol Landis's dad. This is in front of the post office there at Northgate.

12:15.180 --> 12:19.100
And the post office is still there. So if you look real close you can see the windows and make out

12:19.100 --> 12:24.220
the building. That's the post office that's over at Northgate. This is a little bit of the home front.

12:24.220 --> 12:31.020
And here is Carl Landis. He's in front of his house on Dexter. And he and his wife have both

12:31.020 --> 12:33.980
passed away in the last couple of years. Do we know is that house on Dexter's? It's still there.

12:33.980 --> 12:36.380
Oh yeah. Still there. She was my third grade teacher.

12:39.580 --> 12:44.620
This is a Christmas card from the Pentagon. I believe this is around probably maybe 43 or so.

12:46.060 --> 12:52.220
Just an interesting, a wartime Christmas card with kind of a contradiction in terms there.

12:53.180 --> 12:59.660
Merry Christmas from the Pentagon. Okay. This is a female. A lot of people haven't seen

12:59.660 --> 13:04.700
the female before. Letters were handwritten on special paper and then they photographed it,

13:04.700 --> 13:10.460
reduced it, folded it up and carried it over on planes so that it didn't take up so much

13:11.100 --> 13:17.660
space and it didn't weigh so much. But it's kind of an interesting concept. This is probably the

13:17.660 --> 13:22.700
first digital they were thinking of emails. That's right. That's right. That's pretty much.

13:22.700 --> 13:27.260
Precursor of email. Okay. So that's what a standard email looked like back then.

13:27.260 --> 13:37.260
And V was for victory. Exactly. Who's this gentleman? Amelia Salazar and he was working here on campus

13:37.260 --> 13:43.980
in the MSC and also at Sabisa and he left to join the service, came back and went back to work

13:43.980 --> 13:48.940
at the MSC and in Sabisa. So Denise, Judy, came back and I believe you said this was at Camp Bulls.

13:49.020 --> 13:58.860
Yes. And this was given to us by his daughter who she gave us quite a few pieces of memorabilia

13:58.860 --> 14:05.420
from their family, Dorothy Hernandez. Is the rest of the family still here? Yes. Okay.

14:07.580 --> 14:12.380
These are the ration books where you had to use ration stamps and some money to buy for things.

14:12.380 --> 14:16.780
A lot of people have the impression that a stamp, I mean you turn into stamp and you got the

14:16.780 --> 14:23.340
item but you also had to pay a little bit of money for sugar, coffee, butter, gasoline.

14:23.340 --> 14:28.380
A lot of the younger generations have never seen this type of thing. Not exactly. All they're used to

14:28.380 --> 14:33.020
is their Master Carter Visa. That's right. Or their Aggie Buks or more. Yes.

14:33.900 --> 14:39.660
And this is our local veterans group in the World War II. We don't have identification for the

14:40.620 --> 14:47.100
gentlemen but... Which is another good reason. If someone out there... Yeah. Recognize someone or

14:47.100 --> 14:51.820
anyone in the photograph. If you're a neighbor, if you're your uncle, your brother, please give

14:51.820 --> 14:55.980
Anna Call and let them know that the third guy from the right was my uncle Billiard. Whoever it might be.

14:55.980 --> 15:02.460
Absolutely. We need to put some names to faces. This is Catherine Parker. She's from Brian and she

15:03.100 --> 15:11.180
was out at a Vendor Field studying to be a wasp and training. And I don't know any more about her

15:11.180 --> 15:17.900
story. I would love to have more information about her story. But the son of the commander of

15:17.900 --> 15:24.060
the Vendor Field was... gave us a yearbook with a lot of the wasp information. And we were talking

15:24.060 --> 15:31.180
the other day about... The mascot for the wasp was the Fiefinella, which was correct. Cartoon

15:31.180 --> 15:37.260
character wasp that was drawn by Disney for... It was actually created by Walt Disney himself for

15:37.260 --> 15:44.300
that purpose. And I guess that was his way of making his contribution. And this is an

15:44.300 --> 15:48.940
Avenger flying over and you're going to know this better than I am, Kyle. It's over the

15:48.940 --> 15:54.620
Magerrill Islands, the Quadro on a toll, which is out in the South Pacific, which is where I was at

15:54.620 --> 15:58.380
for about two and a half, three years of working for Armed Forces Radio and Television.

15:59.260 --> 16:03.420
Magerrill's great thousands of islands out there. And that does bring back a lot of memories.

16:03.420 --> 16:08.460
I'm always amazed when I look at this at how small that plane is. And this is what the the wasp

16:08.460 --> 16:17.260
for training to fly. And this is a group of civil air patrol out at Kultr Field here. And the...

16:17.260 --> 16:22.460
I don't know if you can see it, the hangar in the background is still out there at Kultr Field.

16:22.460 --> 16:26.460
Up there at the top right, it looks like maybe the top of a quonset hut. Yes, that's what I used to

16:26.940 --> 16:31.820
do. Do we have names for these? I don't know names for these either. Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

16:31.820 --> 16:35.900
out there. Your work is cut out for you. We have lots of names to put to those faces.

16:37.660 --> 16:44.380
This is the first Aggie Muster on Anzio. On Anzio? Yeah. I believe it's 1943. I think so.

16:45.820 --> 16:49.900
Do we know where this picture originated from? Or who donated it? No, I do not.

16:52.060 --> 16:54.460
Same thing, no way to put names to the faces. Right.

16:54.460 --> 16:59.340
Same thing like that. Okay. A&M may have something in their archives that would identify them. Right.

17:00.940 --> 17:05.420
That's a great picture also. Especially if we could find the names of those faces. Now this is...

17:05.420 --> 17:09.660
This is an interesting photo. This is Floyd Gravit. His sister,

17:10.380 --> 17:15.420
Joanna Yeager lives here. And she gave us an opportunity to scan in her whole scrapbook on her

17:15.420 --> 17:21.900
three brothers who all served, two were killed in action. And this brother Floyd was a Japanese

17:21.980 --> 17:27.020
prisoner of war for a number of years. So I didn't even know if he was alive for about three years.

17:27.020 --> 17:32.380
And I was commenting earlier that it looks like a pretty nice bunk there and nice wooden floor.

17:32.380 --> 17:37.260
It looks clean. He looks pretty healthy. But this was obviously at the beginning of his

17:37.260 --> 17:41.500
turn. The very beginning of internment. And he was moved around. Right. So the conditions I would

17:41.500 --> 17:45.660
imagine got worse. And he was... I have seen a photograph of him when he came home. He was

17:45.740 --> 17:50.700
very thin and very undernourished. But for me to just pick, you would think,

17:50.700 --> 17:54.940
she's... Prison Wars don't have it that bad, but they really did. Right. These are the type of

17:54.940 --> 18:00.140
letters that his family would get occasionally that were written by the Imperial Japanese...

18:00.780 --> 18:04.540
You can see that at the top. I don't know what you would do if you were at home and you got a

18:04.540 --> 18:11.500
telegram from the Imperial Japanese Army. Right. And what they were writing, he knew, was contrived.

18:11.500 --> 18:16.700
It wasn't necessarily a normal letter from your son. You know. Right. Right. You can just tell

18:16.700 --> 18:20.300
by the verbiage in the water. Right. But it would not have been his language. Right.

18:22.700 --> 18:27.340
Western Union telegram. Telegrams went back and forth. And my uncle used to send telegrams all

18:27.340 --> 18:31.500
the time to my grandmother and she would nearly have a heart attack. Because Western Union was,

18:31.500 --> 18:35.980
you know, if you got a Western Union then something wrong had happened. Something bad had happened.

18:35.980 --> 18:40.860
But it was the major, quickest way of communicating. Right.

18:46.940 --> 18:53.660
This is James Elbun Jr., who's still living here in college station. He is in this photograph there

18:53.660 --> 18:59.980
on the road to Bajio, in the Philippines, Luzon. And... What's one of his he in this picture? He is in

18:59.980 --> 19:04.380
the middle. Well, he's the one, I think, with his leg crossed, leaning up against the

19:04.380 --> 19:09.980
Jeep or whatever that is. And this was a very narrow road and a very, very steep cliff.

19:11.580 --> 19:17.580
Okay. Now we've jumped, obviously, now we're in color. So this is more or less along the

19:17.580 --> 19:24.300
Vietnam area. Right. This is at the end of the Vietnam war. And this is Bill Brattie and his

19:24.300 --> 19:30.460
group, Bill Brattie's the red-haired one on the back left. He was class of 71 here at A&M. He

19:30.460 --> 19:41.260
also attended Consolidate schools. He was a Cobra trainer at that time. And this is Bill again

19:41.260 --> 19:48.060
in Alaska years later. I was saying post-Vietnam. Yeah. Quite a bit. Things had changed considerably.

19:48.940 --> 19:55.900
His group helped form the unit that rescued the hostages in Toronto. Oh. Okay.

19:56.860 --> 20:01.420
But obviously this is a totally different setting. He was doing some other flying. And this

20:01.420 --> 20:06.620
Russ Harvel, his back row, second from the right. He's the one holding the grenade launcher for

20:07.580 --> 20:13.500
other guys at home. Yeah. That recognized that. That recognized that. And this is in Vietnam.

20:14.620 --> 20:23.020
He's with his patrol there. Russ volunteered in, I believe, 67 to go to Vietnam.

20:23.660 --> 20:29.100
And what his word about now is he sees this here. No. He lives here in in Brian. Okay. So he's here.

20:29.100 --> 20:33.020
He's here. He's alive and kicking. The Harvel family has quite a few, there are members that live

20:33.020 --> 20:41.820
here in College Station in Brian. This is one of my favorite pictures. This is General Woody B. Kyle,

20:42.700 --> 20:48.060
the Kyle Field family. Kyle Field family. And who is that slanky guy to his left? Yeah.

20:48.060 --> 20:57.660
That's what caught my eye. John Wayne was filming the Green Berets in Hwy Vietnam. And that's where Kyle.

20:57.660 --> 21:04.540
So this would have been early 60s. Mid early 60s. Yes. Yes. But I thought it was interesting because

21:04.540 --> 21:11.260
you know, John Wayne was the, you know, major military supporter. And I would have expected him to

21:11.260 --> 21:15.900
take this picture and be there right with the guys. Right. That's another great picture.

21:16.140 --> 21:27.260
And this is the grandson of Will and the light kitty, Worley Andrew Garza. He is in Baghdad in one of the

21:27.260 --> 21:31.740
palaces. I believe that's one of Saddam's palaces. One of his many palaces that they took over.

21:32.540 --> 21:40.140
Yeah. This young man served 15 months. He's in a computer group. And he came home in December.

21:41.100 --> 21:47.660
And just left recently to go back for another 15 months. So he's back on tour again. He's back on tour.

21:48.940 --> 21:55.900
And this is a small group. This is a sniper group. The young man on the second from the right.

21:55.900 --> 22:02.140
The striped on his face. Yeah. Sergeant Mark Michelle is our adoptable petun soldier. His mother and I

22:02.140 --> 22:07.500
were been in school since first grade together. And his grandfather was our family doctor, Dr. Osi Cooper.

22:08.300 --> 22:13.820
So we adopted this Tom. I believe that's Tom's doctor. Yes. J.F. Cooper is Tom. I think he is.

22:15.260 --> 22:20.620
Brother, the team of brothers. Right. Very prominent family here in college station in Bryan.

22:21.420 --> 22:28.780
But Sergeant Mark Michelle has been stationed in Iraq for 15 months. And we adopted them about a

22:28.780 --> 22:39.980
year ago, October. And he is going to be presented, has been presented with a presentation at City Council last

22:39.980 --> 22:48.140
week. So anyway, he's a really neat young man. And we expect to see a whole lot more of him. He'll be in

22:48.140 --> 22:55.180
the service. I think another, another year and a half. And their station didn't last. And this is his

22:55.180 --> 23:02.940
group again. He's in the front row left. The 509th infantry. Okay. The nice group picture. Yes.

23:04.540 --> 23:07.900
And I take it. And obviously if you're a sniper, you'll know this. But obviously there's something

23:07.900 --> 23:13.100
about wearing the sunglasses. It all has to do with the sunglasses. Who's that behind those

23:13.100 --> 23:17.740
ray bands? Yeah. Okay. That was those are some really great pictures. Thank you for bringing them.

23:17.740 --> 23:22.300
Oh, you're welcome. I enjoy sharing them with people. So what other things? Obviously, we just

23:22.300 --> 23:28.540
focused on this. But like I said earlier, project told covers a really, really broad. Oh, absolutely.

23:28.540 --> 23:36.780
We have talked about last summer. We focused on the 60s. And we have an exhibit that's going to come

23:36.780 --> 23:44.140
down soon at the conference center. And but we scanned in a lot of photographs from from that era. And

23:44.140 --> 23:50.060
it doesn't seem like that long ago, but it was 40 years ago. Right. It's scary. But it was my class. But

23:51.020 --> 23:56.460
we have just a wide variety. We have a lot of infrastructure, city of college,

23:56.460 --> 24:00.620
and construction photos when city hall was being built with the ground breaking for that. And

24:02.220 --> 24:07.980
anything and everything. Right. Arts and culture. Yeah. What would someone need to do if they've

24:07.980 --> 24:12.220
found that old box up in the attic or something that their granddad passed away and they're

24:13.020 --> 24:17.740
looking through all this stuff. And my gosh, it's a shame that they're just going to hopefully not

24:17.740 --> 24:22.700
just get rid of it. If they plan to get rid of it, no matter what they do, let me see it first.

24:22.700 --> 24:27.900
I want to go through it first. And we can scan things in and give it back to them. Right. Now you

24:27.900 --> 24:31.820
don't keep the original. We don't keep the original. They can have them back. And we're also

24:32.540 --> 24:37.420
encouraging people to, especially if they have military veterans to participate in the

24:39.020 --> 24:43.980
the veterans history project through the Library of Congress. Right. And they will accept

24:43.980 --> 24:47.180
originals and things like that. Yeah, but we can talk to them about that. And we also have

24:48.460 --> 24:52.700
just ways of documenting their family's history. And then every member of their family can

24:52.700 --> 24:58.620
be online and see the same things they can share it with them. Okay. Well, uh, what about contact

24:58.620 --> 25:06.780
information? You can contact me at city hall 764-3491 and also on our website. There's the website

25:07.260 --> 25:14.460
hold.cstx.gov and uh, combine, see me at city hall. I'd love to visit with people. That's

25:14.460 --> 25:18.460
what I'm saying. You should push all the pictures aside. I do. I push all the stacks. Go to

25:18.460 --> 25:22.140
go to the side and we just sit and visit. We've only got a few minutes left in your last words.

25:22.940 --> 25:27.980
There is a Vietnam Veterans Convention that's going to be at the Hilton February 2nd.

25:28.540 --> 25:33.740
And you can contact me if you want more information about that. We're encouraging the Vietnam

25:33.740 --> 25:37.980
Veterans to participate so that we can document their stories as well. Absolutely. And thank you

25:37.980 --> 25:41.500
for being here. It's been a great show. I'm sure everyone got a lot of good information.

25:41.500 --> 25:48.380
It's a lot of great old pictures. Good. Do we just keep it's great? Good. We'll do it again

25:48.380 --> 25:52.940
sometime. Absolutely. Next second pictures. We'll we'll scan them in and do it again. Great. Thank you.

25:52.940 --> 25:57.660
Thank you for being with us. You know, back in 1986, the city of college station had the

25:57.660 --> 26:04.620
foresight to establish the historic preservation committee or the HPC. The HPC sponsors the

26:04.620 --> 26:10.300
exploring history lunch lecture series on the third Wednesdays of the month. And this popular

26:10.300 --> 26:15.820
and informative series is held from 11.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the college station conference center,

26:15.820 --> 26:21.820
which is located at 1300 George Bush Drive. And the luncheon is only a mere $5 per person.

26:22.460 --> 26:33.340
For more information, you can contact Ann Boykin at a Boykin at cstx.gov or give Anna call at 979-764-3491.

26:33.340 --> 26:37.820
I'm sure she'd be glad to give you all the information you need. For all of us here at KAMU,

26:37.820 --> 26:43.100
their production crew and Tom Terbivill, I'm Kyle Netterville saying so long for now.

26:43.100 --> 26:50.380
Until the next roll call for veterans of the Valley.

27:13.100 --> 27:34.460
In honor of the veterans who have served our country both past and present first national bank,

27:34.460 --> 27:41.180
a Franklin family community bank proudly sponsors veterans of the Valley. Since 1862,

27:41.180 --> 27:47.420
first national has provided local decision making and accessibility as well as banking products

27:47.420 --> 27:51.900
and services to Bras's Valley citizens.

28:11.180 --> 28:18.380
I'm going to be at the Hilton February.

28:18.380 --> 28:26.060
I'm going to be at the conference.

28:26.060 --> 28:27.100
I believe that's Tom.

28:27.640 --> 28:37.580
Sure, in the background is still

28:37.580 --> 28:57.580
He's also from Brian, also served World War II.

28:57.580 --> 29:18.580
A lot of these pictures, some family community back there.

29:18.580 --> 29:21.060
Thanks for joining us on another edition of Veterans.
