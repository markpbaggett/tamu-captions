WEBVTT

01:00.000 --> 01:02.120
and are transferred out to the Mount.

01:02.120 --> 01:07.280
And it's rather hard to see a floating like this in Odyssey,

01:07.280 --> 01:13.160
while it's playing the scene from 2001.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.720
April 13, 1970.

01:15.720 --> 01:18.920
The mood could only be described as relaxed.

01:18.920 --> 01:22.840
Apollo 13, man's fifth lunar mission.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.240
The third scheduled to land on the moon,

01:25.240 --> 01:28.000
continued its tranquil coast.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
This is the crew of Apollo 13, which is over there.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
I see you meet after Apollo's decors

01:36.000 --> 01:38.520
out our backs of the previous basketball

01:38.520 --> 01:41.320
pack for a plus three V-Ev at Odyssey.

01:41.320 --> 01:42.320
Bye.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.800
13, we've got one more item for you when you get a chance.

01:47.800 --> 01:51.400
We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.320
In addition, I have a shaft in front of you.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.120
It's OK.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.560
Or look at the comment benefit if you need it.

01:56.560 --> 01:57.320
OK.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.320
Stand by.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.320
OK, here we have a problem here.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.320
This is Houston's second, please.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.320
Oh, you're coming out of Apollo.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.320
You better be both wonderful.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.320
You might remain being wonderful.

02:11.320 --> 02:13.320
OK, stand by it there, Jane. We're looking at it.

02:13.320 --> 02:16.320
And we had a pretty large bank associated

02:16.320 --> 02:19.320
with the question that warned him.

02:19.320 --> 02:22.320
And the better it could be with the one that had an

02:22.320 --> 02:25.320
emphatic on it once before.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.320
And in our rear, we're starting to go ahead

02:28.320 --> 02:30.320
and start dump the tunnel again.

02:32.320 --> 02:36.320
April 11, 1970, launch day,

02:36.320 --> 02:38.320
the crew of Apollo 13,

02:38.320 --> 02:41.320
Jim Lovell, commander and veteran of three

02:41.320 --> 02:42.320
previous missions.

02:42.320 --> 02:45.320
He had orbited the moon Christmas 1968

02:45.320 --> 02:47.320
on Apollo 8.

02:47.320 --> 02:52.320
Fred Hayes is first time up, lunar module pilot.

02:53.320 --> 02:56.320
Jack Swaggart, command module pilot.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.320
Three days ago, he was on the backup crew.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.320
Now he replaced Ken Mattingley.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.320
Mattingley had been dropped from the mission

03:03.320 --> 03:06.320
because he had been exposed to German measles.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.320
He would watch the launch from Houston's mission control.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.320
Auto sequence initiative, right?

03:11.320 --> 03:12.320
Roger.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.320
Flight booster.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.320
No, yes, 4V-prepressed complete.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.320
Roger.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.320
Flight booster.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.320
Yes, 1C-prepressed complete.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.320
We're on internal power and we're going.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.320
Roger, has a lucky com.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.320
Got your space ahead.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.320
Looks good.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.320
Okay.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.320
MCC, recorded to flight speed.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.320
Ignition flight.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.320
Roger.

03:35.320 --> 03:36.320
On, start, right.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.320
Roger.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.320
That's it, though.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.320
I'll end it.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.320
Roger.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.320
Okay, battle has to look.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.320
Looks good here.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.320
Flight good agreement.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.320
Okay, boost that, either.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.320
That's what he looks good for.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.320
Okay, camp, we're going on the ground.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.320
Okay, we're going on, camp, huh?

03:51.320 --> 03:52.320
Get really good flight.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.320
Roger.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.320
Those stuff, how do you look?

03:59.320 --> 04:00.320
Looks good, flight.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.320
We'll go.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.320
Okay, battle.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.320
We're going, flight.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.320
Looks good here.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.320
Got 1000 good flight.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.320
Okay, econ, CNC.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.320
Looks good, flight.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.320
Looks good, flight.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.320
Okay, search.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.320
Looks fine.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.320
Through MAC, skewn with the overflight.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.320
Roger, boost.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.320
Go for stage, camp, huh?

04:17.320 --> 04:19.320
And climb in, board out, flying, Roger.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.320
Staging flight.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.320
Roger.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.320
Flight five, I could check your confirmed staging.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.320
Roger.

04:27.320 --> 04:30.320
Flight booster, then, board out, was way early.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.320
Okay.

04:31.320 --> 04:34.320
I flight confirmed, number five, engine down.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.320
Roger.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.320
Do you see any problem with that, though, do you?

04:37.320 --> 04:39.320
No, negative, not right now, flight.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.320
Probably other engines are going.

04:41.320 --> 04:44.320
The next step in the routine of lunar flight

04:44.320 --> 04:47.320
was to burn out of Earth orbit toward the moon.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.320
Then, full free of the third stage

04:49.320 --> 04:53.320
and dock with the lunar module Aquarius.

04:53.320 --> 04:56.320
At the controls of the command module Odyssey,

04:56.320 --> 04:58.320
Jack's Wigard.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.320
Where are the doctors?

05:02.320 --> 05:05.320
Right here, understand how the doctors deal.

05:06.320 --> 05:10.320
They pull Aquarius away from the Saturn third stage, the S4B.

05:10.320 --> 05:15.320
Okay, I can see the S4B now at the hatch with that.

05:18.320 --> 05:23.320
Odyssey and Aquarius moved away from Earth toward the moon.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.320
Okay, here we have a problem here.

05:33.320 --> 05:35.320
Five guns.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.320
Go, guns.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.320
We've had a hardware race time.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.320
I don't know what it was.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.320
Okay.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.320
Are you two we've had a problem?

05:41.320 --> 05:43.320
We've had a baby, both vulnerable.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.320
You see an AC bus undervolt, per guns?

05:46.320 --> 05:47.320
E-com.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.320
Negative flight.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.320
I leave the crew reported it.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.320
We've got a main B undervolt.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.320
We may have had an instrumentation problem flight.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.320
Alright.

05:55.320 --> 06:00.320
And we had a pretty large bank associated with the cargo and warranty map.

06:00.320 --> 06:07.320
The sensation I had that I had sold a vibration accompanying the bank,

06:07.320 --> 06:10.320
not a large vibration or shutter.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.320
Is there any kind of leads we can give them

06:12.320 --> 06:13.320
or are we looking at instrumentation?

06:13.320 --> 06:15.320
We've got a real problem or what?

06:15.320 --> 06:22.320
We're reading zero-end two pressure and fuel cell one and 13 psi on fuel cell 302 pressure.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.320
Okay, what do you want to do?

06:24.320 --> 06:25.320
Open circuit fuel cell on a drink.

06:25.320 --> 06:26.320
That's from Flint.

06:26.320 --> 06:34.320
Shut down the reactant valve and I asked for reconformation since when you do that,

06:34.320 --> 06:35.320
it's sort of irreversible.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.320
You shut one of these things down.

06:37.320 --> 06:42.320
Only can be restarted from ground support equipment.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.320
Yeah, that's physically seeing.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.320
And I was thinking, you're looking out the...

06:46.320 --> 06:48.320
...acto, we are a venting something.

06:48.320 --> 06:52.320
We are a venting something out into the...

06:52.320 --> 06:53.320
...appel base.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.320
Okay, that's everybody.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.320
Think of the kind of things we'd be venting.

06:56.320 --> 06:59.320
Do you see you get anything that looks abnormal in your system?

06:59.320 --> 07:00.320
Negative flight.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.320
How about you?

07:01.320 --> 07:03.320
You see anything that...

07:03.320 --> 07:05.320
...with the instrumentation you got that could be venting?

07:05.320 --> 07:07.320
That's a front flight.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.320
And then you look at the system flight.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.320
The van is concerned.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.320
Okay, let's start scanning.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.320
Here is a bulletin from ABC News.

07:14.320 --> 07:19.320
The Apollo 13 spacecraft has had a serious power supply malfunction

07:19.320 --> 07:22.320
that could cause the lunar landing mission to be terminated early.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.320
I assume you've called in your backup.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.320
It becomes flight signal.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.320
If you call in your backup.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.320
It becomes now.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.320
I'll see if we can get some more brain power in the space.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.320
We got one here.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.320
Roger.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.320
At the moment, the astronauts are continuing to try to isolate their trouble.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.320
The late reports as the spacecraft now is operating on battery power alone.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.320
All unnecessary equipment is being turned off.

07:41.320 --> 07:44.320
Okay, now that's everybody keep cool.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.320
We got a limestone attached.

07:46.320 --> 07:48.320
The limspace craft's good.

07:48.320 --> 07:53.320
So if we need to get back home, we got a lim to do a good portion of it with.

07:53.320 --> 07:59.320
Okay, let's make sure that we don't do anything that's going to blow our CSM electrical power

07:59.320 --> 08:05.320
with the batteries or that will cause us to lose the main of the fuel cell number two.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.320
Okay, we want to keep the O2 and that kind of stuff working.

08:09.320 --> 08:13.320
We'd like to have our CS, but we got the command module system.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.320
So we're in good shape if we need to get home.

08:15.320 --> 08:19.320
Let's solve the problem, but let's not make it any worse by guessing.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.320
My concern was increasing all the time.

08:21.320 --> 08:26.320
It went from, I wonder what this is going to do to the landing.

08:26.320 --> 08:32.320
Do I wonder if we can get back home again?

08:32.320 --> 08:34.320
Okay, come on, I'm coming back to you.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.320
Flight, go ahead.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.320
I think the best thing we can do right now is start a power down.

08:39.320 --> 08:46.320
Right about then it was quite apparent to me that we're just a question of time that the command module was going to be dead.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.320
You don't want to get fuel cell pumped off, do you?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.320
We can do that on fuel cell number one flight.

08:51.320 --> 08:55.320
Okay, well let's make sure we don't blow the whole mission.

08:55.320 --> 08:59.320
I think a concern to me is starting, it's slow in equipment.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.320
We had a problem.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.320
We don't know the cause of the problem.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.320
Flight, I've got a feeling we've lost two fuel cells.

09:05.320 --> 09:10.320
I hate to put it that way, but I don't know why we've lost them.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.320
It doesn't all tag up.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.320
Network from flight.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.320
Flight network.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.320
Bring me up another computer in the RTCC.

09:16.320 --> 09:22.320
We got one machine on the RTCC and we got dual CP, downstate.

09:22.320 --> 09:27.320
Okay, I want another machine up in the RTCC and I want a bunch of guys keep running delogues down there.

09:27.320 --> 09:28.320
Roger that.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.320
What all this means is only speculation at this point.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.320
First, though there has been some tumbling or rotation of the spacecraft,

09:34.320 --> 09:37.320
the astronauts do not appear to be in any immediate danger.

09:37.320 --> 09:46.320
I'll tell you what, GNC, can you get somebody in the back room to try to figure out what the equivalent delta V is we're getting?

09:46.320 --> 09:51.320
So that we can see if we can backtrack to see if we can figure out what's vending.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.320
Drugs we're going to try, it's light.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.320
Okay.

09:55.320 --> 10:01.320
When I looked up and saw both, the oxygen pressure is one actually, zero and another one going down.

10:01.320 --> 10:08.320
It dawned on me and I'm sure Jack had read about the same time that we were indeed in serious trouble.

10:08.320 --> 10:15.320
The only way to survive the situation was to transfer to the LEM.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.320
Flighty Com.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.320
Go, go, go.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.320
The pressure in O2 tank 1 is all the way down to 297.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.320
We've ever think about getting in the LEM or using the LEM systems.

10:23.320 --> 10:28.320
I'd say this is a serious situation that we have ever had in the man's face point.

10:28.320 --> 10:32.320
We've always called the LEM a good light boat under those circumstances.

10:32.320 --> 10:40.320
If at any time in the mission however the LEM had separated and we would have gotten ourselves into a rendezvous situation

10:40.320 --> 10:47.320
or the command module being around the moon, then what you state is absolutely true.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.320
It would be a fatal situation.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.320
Telling me you're from flight.

10:53.320 --> 10:59.320
Go ahead, light. I want you to get some guys putting out minimum power in the LEM to sustain life.

10:59.320 --> 11:03.320
The accident had occurred 200,000 miles from Earth.

11:03.320 --> 11:09.320
Lovelled, swigored and haze rode in the lunar module attached to a lifeless command module.

11:09.320 --> 11:13.320
Apollo 13 had started as a mission of scientific exploration.

11:13.320 --> 11:19.320
It was now a matter of survival.

11:19.320 --> 11:24.320
Since the command module was dead except for the oxygen and power hoarded for reentry,

11:24.320 --> 11:30.320
the guidance platform of Aquarius designed to land on and take off from the moon would have to be used.

11:30.320 --> 11:37.320
The first milestone, and I consider this after the accident, I guess, more or less the survival now,

11:37.320 --> 11:42.320
the first milestone was to get alignment on the LEM platform.

11:43.320 --> 11:50.320
Alignments are important because without knowing exactly which way the attitude of the spacecraft is and space is,

11:50.320 --> 11:58.320
there's no way to tell how to burn or how to use the engines of that spacecraft to get the proper trajectory to come home.

11:58.320 --> 12:08.320
The position we are now in the Earth and plane, we have to go around the moon to get back if we're going to use the dip-sangian.

12:08.320 --> 12:14.320
You would have had enough capability with the SDS engine, but of course we don't very use that now.

12:14.320 --> 12:18.320
So we have to go through the back side of the moon and come back.

12:18.320 --> 12:25.320
To get into the correct orbit around the moon, the crew had burned out of a trajectory that would automatically bring them back to Earth.

12:25.320 --> 12:29.320
They would have to get back onto a safe course toward Earth.

12:29.320 --> 12:33.320
He needs to put his throttle to man also, right?

12:33.320 --> 12:37.320
Throughout all ten minutes, he's at 29 percent now, everything.

12:37.320 --> 12:43.320
This maneuver again was completed on time and because it was a manual burn, we had a three-man operation.

12:43.320 --> 12:48.320
Jack would take care of the time. He'd tell us when the light off the engine went to stop it.

12:48.320 --> 12:54.320
Said, handled pitch maneuver. I handled the roll maneuver and I pushed the button to start and stop the engines.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.320
The quarrier should go for the burn.

13:02.320 --> 13:05.320
40 percent.

13:05.320 --> 13:09.320
Okay, the quarrier should look good.

13:09.320 --> 13:12.320
Oh, shut down.

13:12.320 --> 13:17.320
The first problem was solved. They were back on the path to Earth.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.320
But there were many other problems to be solved.

13:20.320 --> 13:30.320
From a building at Houston's Man Spacecraft Center, systems experts coordinated the coast-to-coast effort to get the crew back.

13:30.320 --> 13:36.320
One of the big problems was consumables. There would be enough to eat and drink.

13:36.320 --> 13:46.320
But in space, there are other factors. Oxygen to breathe, electrical power to keep the spacecraft alive, water to cool the equipment and keep it operating.

13:46.320 --> 13:55.320
What we'll be doing until we get them back on the water is concentrating on everything that their lives are dependent upon at the moment rather than worrying about the accident.

13:55.320 --> 14:05.320
Because there's nothing we can do about that now. It appears at the present time that everything is under control and that we have a safe situation at the moment.

14:05.320 --> 14:11.320
Hey, I want to say you guys are doing real good work. So are you guys, Jack?

14:11.320 --> 14:24.320
We are about 70 hours from home. And we think we have the situation in control. We projected the consumables as I've described.

14:24.320 --> 14:35.320
And we have a plan for carrying out the rest of the mission. But there is going to be no relaxation at all as far as that goes from down to splat.

14:36.320 --> 14:44.320
There was a key decision to be made before a power 13 went behind the moon. Where to bring them down.

14:44.320 --> 14:54.320
Their present course would take them to the Indian Ocean where recovery would be difficult. A burn to bring them home quicker would take them to the Pacific Ocean near the recovery forces.

14:54.320 --> 15:03.320
Bringing them home even fast to would place them in the South Atlantic again away from recovery forces. It was decided to take them to the Pacific.

15:05.320 --> 15:14.320
We run these simulators both here and at the Cape and at the contractors that continuously ever since last night.

15:14.320 --> 15:24.320
We've tried to simulate virtually everything that we've had the crew to do that is non-normal that they've done.

15:24.320 --> 15:33.320
And we've proven most of the thing that we've been able to run on the simulator prior to passing it up to them. There may be some details.

15:33.320 --> 15:38.320
But at least we've checked the feasibility of everything we've done and we'll continue to do that.

15:38.320 --> 15:46.320
They passed 137 miles from the moon. For level it was the second time that he had seen the moon so near.

15:46.320 --> 15:51.320
But there was no time for contemplation. There was another critical burn coming.

15:51.320 --> 15:56.320
Okay, look at the cameras for the way. Let's get off at the first.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.320
Let's go. Yeah, one can't.

15:58.320 --> 16:04.320
And in Houston, the newsman poured in to tell an anxious world the story.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.320
The world is destroying the water.

16:11.320 --> 16:19.320
Shortly after Apollo 13 had separated from the Saturn III stage, the stage had been sent on to a trajectory toward the moon.

16:19.320 --> 16:24.320
Its impact would be recorded by the seismometer left by Apollo 12.

16:24.320 --> 16:38.320
By the way, according to the results now from Apollo 12's seismometer, looks like you're booster just hit the moon and it's rocking it a little bit.

16:38.320 --> 16:46.320
Well, these propellers worked up this flight. After glad we didn't have a limb impact.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.320
Jimmy, you are a go for the burn. Go for the burn.

16:49.320 --> 16:52.320
Roger, on the, go for the burn.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.320
Got him. It's okay.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.320
We're good flight. Control. Okay.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.320
We're okay. Five. Tell me where go. Five.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.320
Ain't go okay.

17:01.320 --> 17:05.320
We're good flight. Ground confirms ignition.

17:05.320 --> 17:08.320
Well, buddy, 40%.

17:08.320 --> 17:12.320
Well, it's Houston. You're looking good.

17:12.320 --> 17:15.320
Roger.

17:17.320 --> 17:20.320
Shut down. Roger, shut down.

17:20.320 --> 17:23.320
I say that was a good burn.

17:23.320 --> 17:26.320
Five. Cause now we want to power it on as it is possible.

17:26.320 --> 17:27.320
To understand.

17:27.320 --> 17:36.320
To conserve the electric power and cooling water, the crew shut down all but the vital life-sustaining systems of the limb.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.320
I think the limb spacecraft's in excellent shape.

17:39.320 --> 17:43.320
And I think it's fully capable of getting the crew back.

17:43.320 --> 17:50.320
I think as we have found before every time we put the limb spacecraft to a test, it's always done much more than it was guaranteed to do.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.320
And I think this is a good case in point.

17:53.320 --> 17:58.320
Concern of the consumables. Cooling water. Electric power.

17:58.320 --> 18:03.320
The limb water gun was leaking and we shut that off.

18:03.320 --> 18:07.320
I guess it leaked about a quart of water I would estimate.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.320
But it took me about two days to get my feet dry.

18:10.320 --> 18:20.320
Of course, I think you were all aware that the temperatures were going down in both vehicles and it's made for very chilly feet for a couple days.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.320
I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

18:44.320 --> 18:47.320
I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.320
I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.320
I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

18:53.320 --> 18:56.320
I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.320
I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

18:59.320 --> 19:02.320
I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.320
I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.320
I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

19:07.320 --> 19:20.320
Lord, your astronauts will come back safe.

19:20.320 --> 19:36.320
If I may be serious for one moment and ask the entire audience for a moment of prayer for the crewmen of the Apollo 13,

19:36.320 --> 19:39.320
I will hold silence for a moment.

19:48.320 --> 19:54.320
ICS-A stands at 62% and B at 62%.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.320
I see we've gone all along, dialed on his face.

20:01.320 --> 20:09.320
The first thing about getting peeled back is because I didn't get any sleep when I was at home.

20:09.320 --> 20:15.320
Command Mods were just slowly kept going down in temperature until I think just prior to reentry.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.320
It was down to about 38 degrees.

20:18.320 --> 20:22.320
Along with that, it was a sort of chilling coldness.

20:22.320 --> 20:26.320
The walls were perspiring, the windows were completely wet.

20:26.320 --> 20:29.320
It wasn't too healthy, I recall.

20:29.320 --> 20:35.320
We went in there to get some hot dogs one day and it was like reaching in with a freezer or the food.

20:45.320 --> 20:52.320
If you want my opinion on how they handled the situation, when it happened to handle the exact life we'd expect them to be.

20:52.320 --> 20:57.320
Everybody was well on top of it as anybody could be who knew what we knew which isn't very much.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.320
I'll have to admit.

20:58.320 --> 21:07.320
But I think they did everything right within knowledge that was available to us and the timely fashion, which is what we expect them to do.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.320
They did a beautiful job of it.

21:09.320 --> 21:16.320
We actually had a third little sleep-free strength which Fred does then put on and buttoned up and kept a little bit warm.

21:16.320 --> 21:21.320
The astronauts faced another problem. Their own exhaled breath.

21:21.320 --> 21:28.320
The lithium hydroxide chemical to take carbon dioxide out of the air was not sufficient in the lunar module.

21:28.320 --> 21:34.320
They would have to adapt the canisters from the command module to fit the hoses in the limb.

21:34.320 --> 21:40.320
On the ground an adapter was fashioned from materials the crew had available in the limb.

21:40.320 --> 21:44.320
Cardboard from a checklist, plastic bags and tape.

21:44.320 --> 21:52.320
After checkout in an environmental chamber, the directions for construction were sent up to Aquarius.

21:52.320 --> 21:58.320
At this point in time I think the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was reading about 15 millimeters.

21:58.320 --> 22:08.320
And we constructed two of these things and put them on line and I think within an hour the partial pressure of CO2 was down to two tenths.

22:08.320 --> 22:19.320
So you see that survival now became one of initiative and ingenuity and it was one which the ground continually helped us along.

22:19.320 --> 22:25.320
We had all kinds of people on the ground trying to think of ways of extending our lifetime.

22:25.320 --> 22:35.320
There would be still another burn. A mid-course correction to get Apollo 13 into the narrow corridor through the atmosphere for a safe return to work.

22:36.320 --> 22:39.320
Where'd burn out of two flights? College?

22:41.320 --> 22:43.320
Ignition.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.320
The thrust looks good.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.320
Shut down.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.320
Hang in there, it won't be long.

22:52.320 --> 22:57.320
There were moments when I didn't know how much consumables we had, whether we could make it back or not.

22:57.320 --> 23:01.320
But yeah, in a situation like that there's only one thing you can do.

23:02.320 --> 23:07.320
You just keep going and you just keep thinking up where you get more consumables.

23:07.320 --> 23:10.320
And so that's exactly what we did.

23:10.320 --> 23:15.320
On April 17th they prepared for reentry.

23:18.320 --> 23:24.320
After a small course correction burn they jettison the damaged service module.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.320
Copy that.

23:28.320 --> 23:32.320
And there's one whole side of that big spare business.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.320
Is that right?

23:34.320 --> 23:38.320
It's on the whole panel that's blown out, almost probably a base of the engine.

23:38.320 --> 23:41.320
Really a mess. Man, that's unbelievable.

23:43.320 --> 23:49.320
Next they got back into Odyssey to jettison the quarriest prior to entry into the atmosphere.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.320
Let's get it...

23:51.320 --> 23:54.320
Okay, copy that.

23:54.320 --> 23:57.320
So, well, Aquarius, thank you.

23:59.320 --> 24:03.320
Okay, LOS in a minute or a minute and a half.

24:03.320 --> 24:06.320
An entry attitude we'd like on me, Charlie.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.320
And welcome home.

24:08.320 --> 24:11.320
Thank you.

24:24.320 --> 24:27.320
Odyssey Houston standing by over.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.320
Here we go.

24:55.320 --> 24:59.320
Odyssey Houston we show you how it's amazing.

24:59.320 --> 25:02.320
Really looks great.

25:02.320 --> 25:05.320
Odyssey Houston we show you how it's amazing.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.320
Really looks great.

25:09.320 --> 25:13.320
Oh, I'm not going to talk about Odyssey.

25:13.320 --> 25:16.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:16.320 --> 25:19.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:19.320 --> 25:22.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:22.320 --> 25:25.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:25.320 --> 25:28.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:28.320 --> 25:31.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:42.320 --> 25:46.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:46.320 --> 25:49.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston and the FOI.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:53.320 --> 25:56.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.320
I'm going to talk about Odyssey Houston.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.320
Copy that.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.320
We also heard one of Kelsey Christ,

26:36.320 --> 27:01.680
I recall Captain that when I spoke to you on the phone, you said that you regretted

27:01.680 --> 27:08.680
that you were unable to complete your mission. I hereby declare that this was a successful

27:08.680 --> 27:16.340
mission. From the start, the exploration of space has been hazardous adventure. The

27:16.340 --> 27:25.880
voyage of Apollo 13 dramatized its risks. The men of Apollo 13 by their poise and skill

27:25.880 --> 27:33.760
under the most intense kind of pressure epitomized the character that accepts danger and

27:33.760 --> 27:44.400
surmoses. There is the spirit that filled America. Your missions served your country. It

27:44.400 --> 27:51.320
served to remind us all of our proud heritage of a nation. To remind us that in this age

27:51.320 --> 28:01.120
of technicians and scientific marvels that the individual still counts, that in a crisis,

28:01.120 --> 28:07.320
the character of a man or a man will make the difference.

28:07.320 --> 28:19.320
Go search it, go procedures, go AFD, go network, go computer suit, go.

28:19.320 --> 28:25.320
God, network give me an hammer. RTC on FD conference. RTC on FD conference.

28:25.320 --> 28:32.320
Okay, I'll flight in colors. Let's play it cool.

28:55.320 --> 29:02.320
Let's go.

29:25.320 --> 29:40.320
Thank you.
