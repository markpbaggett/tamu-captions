00:00.000 --> 00:01.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:01.640 --> 00:02.640
first place.

00:02.640 --> 00:03.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:03.640 --> 00:04.640
first place.

00:04.640 --> 00:05.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:05.640 --> 00:06.640
first place.

00:06.640 --> 00:07.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:07.640 --> 00:08.640
first place.

00:08.640 --> 00:09.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:09.640 --> 00:10.640
first place.

00:10.640 --> 00:11.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:11.640 --> 00:12.640
first place.

00:12.640 --> 00:13.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:13.640 --> 00:14.640
first place.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:15.640 --> 00:16.640
first place.

00:16.640 --> 00:17.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:17.640 --> 00:18.640
first place.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:19.640 --> 00:20.640
first place.

00:20.640 --> 00:21.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:21.640 --> 00:22.640
first place.

00:22.640 --> 00:23.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:23.640 --> 00:24.640
first place.

00:24.640 --> 00:25.640
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:25.640 --> 00:26.640
first place.

00:27.600 --> 00:33.480
I'm going to go back to the

00:33.480 --> 00:35.480
first place.

00:35.480 --> 00:37.980
What's deep inside here?

00:37.980 --> 00:39.480
So, what's deep inside here?

00:39.480 --> 00:40.480
So, what's deep inside here?

00:42.280 --> 00:44.120
So, what's the deep inside here?

00:51.120 --> 00:52.720
So, what's deep inside here?

00:52.720 --> 00:54.600
I'm going to have to go back to the

00:54.600 --> 00:55.600
workplace.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.600
Okay, I'm out.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.600
Okay, you're out.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.600
Ed White is the first American to walk in space,

01:02.600 --> 01:04.600
but he's not the first man.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.600
A Russian was ten weeks earlier.

01:07.600 --> 01:11.600
America's Cold War enemy has won every first of the space race.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.600
Ever since the Russian satellite Sputnik,

01:14.600 --> 01:17.600
the United States has been second best.

01:18.600 --> 01:27.600
Now the two superpowers are locked in a titanic struggle for world leadership.

01:27.600 --> 01:33.600
And the moon has become the ultimate battleground.

01:33.600 --> 01:40.600
We felt we were in a war for technological supremacy and primacy in the world,

01:40.600 --> 01:44.600
and we felt that the America had been challenged so badly

01:44.600 --> 01:48.600
and so strongly by the Russians that we were in the hole.

01:48.600 --> 01:52.600
I've often thought that the space program, the space race,

01:52.600 --> 01:56.600
quote-unquote, really took the place of a war.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.600
It wasn't a shooting battle, but to me,

02:00.600 --> 02:04.600
it was every bit as important as the other battles that were shooting battles.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.600
We had non-Corea.

02:06.600 --> 02:11.600
The race to the moon is the adventure story of the century.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.600
A tale of discovery and risk.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.600
A hero's and sacrifice.

02:20.600 --> 02:24.600
For the United States, it will become an eight-year obsession,

02:24.600 --> 02:32.600
costing $25 billion and harnessing the labors of 400,000 American workers.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.600
It is fueled by a booming economy,

02:36.600 --> 02:41.600
and driven by the fear of falling behind a Cold War enemy.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.600
But the final challenge comes from a dynamic leader who gambled

02:45.600 --> 02:50.600
he could inspire his country to reach farther than anyone before.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.600
Before this decade is out, a blending of man on the moon

02:53.600 --> 02:57.600
and returning him safely to the Earth.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.600
And in the end, an epic journey launched out of cold political necessity

03:02.600 --> 03:08.600
has the most human of consequences, a greater understanding of ourselves.

03:08.600 --> 03:13.600
The Earth from here is a great way to take that into space.

03:16.600 --> 03:20.600
In the race to the moon, both sides have their champions.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.600
The Soviet cosmonauts are the vanguard of a new Russian revolution,

03:24.600 --> 03:29.600
heroes of the march to supremacy and space.

03:30.600 --> 03:35.600
America's astronauts are treated more like movie stars than military test pilots.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.600
They're the best of the best, and they know it.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.600
You had to know you were good.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.600
You had to believe in yourself.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.600
You had to know by God when you made a decision.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.600
You thought it was the right one.

03:45.600 --> 03:50.600
It's not that you just took behind it, but you had to know you were good enough to make the right decision.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.600
We get very clearly seen on rice.

03:52.600 --> 03:58.600
The men who ride the rockets into space get the glory, but they take the risks.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.600
And the race to the moon has plenty of both.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.600
One of the things you got to remember about astronauts, they don't mind dying,

04:06.600 --> 04:09.600
but what they can't stand is to screw up.

04:09.600 --> 04:14.600
So they were always very, very focused on doing the job right,

04:14.600 --> 04:17.600
and that was the first thing they focused on.

04:19.600 --> 04:25.600
January 1967, America is about to discover the terrible risks of the race.

04:26.600 --> 04:31.600
The Apollo program is getting underway, the series of missions that will shoot for the moon.

04:31.600 --> 04:38.600
The first rides are going to veterans Gus Guisson, Ed White, and Rookie Roger Chaffey.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.600
Their capsule is still playing with technical problems,

04:42.600 --> 04:47.600
but NASA is moving quickly to land a man on the moon by the end of the decade.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.600
The Apollo 1 launch is just over three weeks away.

04:51.600 --> 04:56.600
At 6.31pm January 27, 1967,

04:56.600 --> 05:02.600
Guisson, White, and Chaffey sit atop their rocket for what should be another routine test.

05:02.600 --> 05:07.600
Roger Chaffey was over in the right-hand couch, Gus Grisson was over in the left side,

05:07.600 --> 05:11.600
and Ed White was in the middle.

05:12.600 --> 05:18.600
Suddenly there's a spark and a flashfire fueled by pure oxygen rips through the capsule.

05:18.600 --> 05:26.600
Ed White's job was to reach up behind his head and try and undo because they were lying on their backs to try and undo this hatch.

05:26.600 --> 05:33.600
But the hatch is a killer. There's a fatal design flaw. It takes 90 seconds to open.

05:33.600 --> 05:38.600
The fire needs only 20 seconds to burn through the astronaut's oxygen hoses.

05:38.600 --> 05:42.600
The fire is so intense, it ruptures the hull of the capsule.

05:43.600 --> 05:48.600
For a lot of people it was very hard to think of astronauts dying not in space,

05:48.600 --> 05:57.600
not in the course of a mission, not because the booster blows up, but on the pad where there are rescue workers on the other side of the hatch

05:57.600 --> 06:00.600
and they can't do anything to save them.

06:01.600 --> 06:12.600
I can remember being at the grave sign of Roger Chaffey who was my neighbor at the time.

06:12.600 --> 06:22.600
And when that final load of taps sounded, I wondered whether that wasn't the death knoll for the entire Apollo program.

06:23.600 --> 06:36.600
From this moment the Apollo 1 tragedy becomes known simply as the fire. NASA doesn't fly again for 18 months.

06:36.600 --> 06:40.600
Astronaut Frank Bourman rallies the troops.

06:40.600 --> 06:46.600
Frank had a way of putting things. We can't find any one person to blame for this thing. We're all to blame for it.

06:47.600 --> 06:52.600
We knew what was going on. We just did not appreciate the danger and the risk that we were taking.

06:52.600 --> 07:02.600
And we hadn't taken all the necessary precautions. So in a sense we were all guilty and probably we all carried a sense of that guilt.

07:04.600 --> 07:10.600
NASA is still recovering from the fire when the Soviets are stopped in their tracks by their own disaster.

07:11.600 --> 07:19.600
They lose their first cosmonaut when Vladimir Comarov's capsule hurtles into the ground at 400 miles per hour.

07:19.600 --> 07:25.600
After his state funeral, the Soviets too put their space program on hold.

07:25.600 --> 07:34.600
Night aside flies for a year and a half. Then suddenly, in the autumn of 1968, the race is back on.

07:34.600 --> 07:39.600
The next big goal for both sides is to put men in orbit around the moon.

07:39.600 --> 07:46.600
But Apollo's lunar module is still in the factory when the CIA drops a bombshell.

07:49.600 --> 07:55.600
The intelligence agency believes the Soviets are planning to loop men around the moon.

07:55.600 --> 08:04.600
NASA takes a gamble. Outdo the Russians by sending a manned flight to orbit the moon ahead of schedule, a more difficult task.

08:05.600 --> 08:12.600
But NASA's own internal memos show it's worried another failure poses grave risks to the Apollo program.

08:12.600 --> 08:16.600
There might also be what it calls undue crew risk.

08:17.600 --> 08:21.600
It was a real sweaty decision. There were some people who were violently opposed to it.

08:21.600 --> 08:28.600
But they finally all climbed on board and said, okay, you know, the equipment's here. We might as well give it a try.

08:29.600 --> 08:37.600
The equipment is the Saturn V. It's a monster, but the only thing with enough brute force to propel Americans to the moon.

08:38.600 --> 08:49.600
The Saturn V has been tested only twice on manned. Now the crew of Apollo 8 Jim Lovell, Bill Andersen, Frank Borman, will be the first to ride the monster.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.600
10, 9. We have ignition sequence start.

08:54.600 --> 08:59.600
The Saturn V is as powerful as a small atomic bomb and every bit as violent.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.600
The engine's alive. The war.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.600
And no one who rides this rocket will ever forget it.

09:07.600 --> 09:12.600
They hear almost like a distant rumble of thunder. And they're the rumbling kind of swells.

09:12.600 --> 09:20.600
And now it's more of a roar. And it begins to penetrate even the walls of the spacecraft and their helmets.

09:21.600 --> 09:26.600
And then finally this thing gives a kind of a jolt and then leaves the earth.

09:28.600 --> 09:34.600
And with the thunder of the world's mightiest rocket, the race for the moon is on with a vengeance.

09:43.600 --> 09:49.600
The Saturn V is the first to ride the monster.

09:50.600 --> 09:57.600
We have commit. We have looked off. We have looked off at 7.51 AM.

09:58.600 --> 10:03.600
America's hopes to be first to the moon are riding on the monster Saturn V.

10:04.600 --> 10:08.600
And for the crew of Apollo 8, it's the ride of a lifetime.

10:08.600 --> 10:14.600
And up in the command module, these guys are being thrown around in their seats against their straps.

10:15.600 --> 10:23.600
It was so violent that Bill Anders thought, you know, my God, we must have caught a fin of the rocket on the tower and we're going to come down in a second.

10:25.600 --> 10:29.600
I had the sensation that maybe I was in the midst of a living thing.

10:30.600 --> 10:37.600
The gurgling and the shaking and it was an experience as if you were an element of a living machine.

10:39.600 --> 10:43.600
As it climbed, you could see it really peddling hard.

10:44.600 --> 10:49.600
And you could see it start to pick up momentum as it burned off tons and tons of fuel every second.

10:50.600 --> 10:54.600
It gave you the impression that this was a machine on its way to someplace.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.600
That someplace is the moon's orbit.

10:59.600 --> 11:06.600
A 25,000 miles per hour, the Saturn V finally generates an upspeed to burst free of Earth's gravity.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.600
It is December 1968.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.600
The Apollo 8 gives you a open stage.

11:12.600 --> 11:18.600
Borman, Lovell and Anders are the first spacemen, the first to leave Earth orbit and dive into deep space.

11:19.600 --> 11:24.600
But while others may be moved to poetry to Apollo 8's commander, it's just a job.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.600
Apollo 8 was a great adventure, but it was also hard work.

11:29.600 --> 11:33.600
I've never been romantically inclined about space travel.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.600
Star Trek, I've never seen that doesn't at all interest me.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.600
I know I was going on an important mission and I wanted to do it right.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.600
Borman is all business with no time for excess baggage.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.600
It was hard enough to think about going to the moon and coming back.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.600
Don't complicate things with things like TV camera.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.600
I mean, he didn't want the TV camera because he thought it was going to be a bother.

11:56.600 --> 12:01.600
But Borman's been overruled and the Earth sees itself from afar for the first time.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.600
From a camera that nearly didn't make the ride.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.600
And you're all looking at your stars that seem from 108,000 miles out of space.

12:11.600 --> 12:16.600
They are black and white and fuzzy, but the power of these images is irresistible.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.600
We really did see it in a new way.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.600
Lots of people look at those images and they say,

12:21.600 --> 12:27.600
Kali, it really is this tiny little blue-green ball that's out there.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.600
White clouds on it and it looks different from anything else we've seen.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.600
And it's just hanging there in this blackness.

12:36.600 --> 12:41.600
Mike, what I keep imagining is it's not about some lonely travel or from another planet.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.600
What I think about the Earth is from this altitude.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.600
Whether I think it be an avid or not.

12:48.600 --> 12:53.600
On Christmas Eve, Apollo 8 orbits the moon 10 times.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.600
The moon is a different thing to each one of us.

12:58.600 --> 13:07.600
I know my own impression is that it's a bad, only, for a big time, existence or a span of nothing.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.600
The voyage makes poets of them all.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.600
But it's not the moon that finally catches Frank Borman's heart and eye.

13:16.600 --> 13:20.600
It is the home of everything he holds dear and it fills him with wonder.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.600
Ah, ah, that's what it was.

13:25.600 --> 13:30.600
At that point, I think we were all aware that this was a historic moment.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.600
And then it was, okay, now let's go home.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.600
That didn't last too long because we had a lot of work to do then in prep break.

13:39.600 --> 13:44.600
This came at a node between getting there and doing the work and then getting prepared for the trip.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.600
And then the moon came back to the home.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.600
And God said, let there be light and there was light.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
And God saw the light.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.600
They were good and God divided the light from the darkness.

14:01.600 --> 14:08.600
I think Frank Borman came up with some wonderful eloquent stuff during that television show when they read from Genesis.

14:09.600 --> 14:14.600
And from the true Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a great night.

14:15.600 --> 14:20.600
Merry Christmas and God bless all of you, all of you on the good earth.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.600
All of you on the good earth.

14:23.600 --> 14:27.600
Just to this day I get chills thinking about that. It's a beautiful thing.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.600
America's gamble pays off.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.600
NASA has won the first big heat in the race to the moon.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.600
But the final and most dangerous challenge is still ahead.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.600
When we got Apollo 8 out there, the Russians knew they had had it.

14:45.600 --> 14:50.600
It was that simple. But they knew that a landing was not going to be very far away.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.600
So yeah, I think Apollo 8 kind of put the nail in the coffin.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.600
But the Russians aren't dead yet.

15:03.600 --> 15:08.600
And what the Americans don't know is that Moscow still has an ace up its sleeve.

15:15.600 --> 15:22.600
This is a adventure in the first half of 19-feet and west Texas there is a running competition which has won the post-19 bar 3 out of 16.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.600
The crash while overcrowded.

15:42.600 --> 15:49.280
bold challenge. Five Apollo missions are scheduled. The workhorse, the Saturn 5, has never been

15:49.280 --> 15:55.680
pushed so hard, and the monster is delivering flawlessly.

15:55.680 --> 15:59.640
They were just pumping out Saturn 5, like there was no tomorrow. I mean, there was a new

15:59.640 --> 16:04.640
launch every couple of months.

16:04.640 --> 16:10.160
But the Soviets are far from quitting. A U.S. spy satellite snatches top secret photos

16:10.160 --> 16:17.000
of a giant new Soviet rocket, the N1. The evidence indicates the Russians may finally

16:17.000 --> 16:20.920
be aiming a manned moon shop themselves.

16:20.920 --> 16:25.400
It looked to have the same size, it looked to have the same capability that the Saturn

16:25.400 --> 16:30.840
5 would have. It was a moon rocket. What they didn't know was that the Soviets were

16:30.840 --> 16:33.400
having enormous problems with it.

16:33.400 --> 16:41.240
Every time they tried to launch that N1, it blew up on them. Seconds into the launch.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.000
They just exploded.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.280
Roger, here's from the Apollo 10. You can tell the world that we have arrived.

16:49.280 --> 16:57.520
May 1969, Apollo 10. The dress rehearsal for the moon landing. Eugene, Surnin, and Tom

16:57.520 --> 17:02.960
Stafford will do everything but touch down, buzzing the moon's surface closer than anyone

17:02.960 --> 17:07.880
before. I mean, when we came down, we were screaming across that surface. And we were

17:07.880 --> 17:13.120
47,000 feet above the, quote, sea level part of the surface, but we had tried gigantic

17:13.120 --> 17:14.120
mountains tired enough.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.920
Well, here's to Houston. This is Souti.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.920
Right, go ahead.

17:18.920 --> 17:22.760
It's going. We are down among them, Charlie.

17:22.760 --> 17:27.440
And I said more, we are down among them. I don't know what happened to my English language

17:27.440 --> 17:30.920
when I got to the moon, but it changed. I don't know if it's something in me. But, well,

17:30.920 --> 17:34.400
I just felt like when we were coming down over this mountain, we had to pick up our feet

17:34.400 --> 17:38.400
because we were going to just, you know, we're going to drag the landing gear, the lunar

17:38.400 --> 17:42.480
mongrel over top of some of those mountains. We were so close.

17:42.480 --> 17:49.240
The sea of tranquility, which men have eyed for centuries. The Apollo 10 crew seized

17:49.240 --> 17:55.920
it in more detail than Galileo ever dreamed. It is here. The first landing will be attempted

17:55.920 --> 17:56.920
in just eight weeks.

17:56.920 --> 18:02.640
The Apollo 10 looks much smoother than from the Orbit or Photo Show. It's still up to

18:02.640 --> 18:07.360
make 25 to 30 percent. It's a semi-clear area.

18:07.360 --> 18:12.040
Sun and the Stafford are just here to survey, but they're so close they can almost make

18:12.040 --> 18:14.200
history themselves.

18:14.200 --> 18:19.560
Knowing that it was Sun and Tom Stafford, two wild men, in charge at that point, there's

18:19.560 --> 18:25.560
a lot of us that were kind of thinking, you know, I wonder if they really will. And it

18:25.560 --> 18:29.080
would not have been surprised to see them say, oh, what the heck, you know, but they

18:29.080 --> 18:31.920
were truly, they were outfitted for a landing.

18:31.920 --> 18:32.920
OK, Jonathan, what's wrong with you?

18:32.920 --> 18:37.920
But the thought runs through you, Gene Sternen's mind, given the chance he and Stafford could

18:37.920 --> 18:40.960
have been first to make the giant step.

18:40.960 --> 18:44.680
You know, head we head fuel, we could have gone down and we could have landed. And we

18:44.680 --> 18:49.240
would have done it successfully. We'll ever know now, but I still think we could have.

18:49.240 --> 18:52.000
That new beacon, you're looking OK for the instruction bar.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.240
And suddenly, without warning, the lunar module lurches out of control. And Sternen nearly

18:58.240 --> 19:00.840
gets his wish to be first on the moon.

19:00.840 --> 19:06.280
Here we are, all of a sudden, my world changed. I'm looking at this fantastic science fiction

19:06.280 --> 19:11.160
world, and then all of a sudden, we're in chaos.

19:11.160 --> 19:16.120
All of a sudden, the whole thing started gyrating wildly. I mean, Gene Sternen looked

19:16.120 --> 19:21.760
out the window and saw the moon's horizon just tilt, you know, rapidly and start to swing

19:21.760 --> 19:24.560
like he was on some kind of a carnival ride.

19:24.560 --> 19:30.200
Tell me, Brown, Houston, they got safe. They had a wild, a gyration, you know, but they

19:30.200 --> 19:31.200
got safe.

19:31.200 --> 19:35.560
I find myself, they got spacecrafted, we're only in the spin and in all of a sudden, we

19:35.560 --> 19:41.320
got an under control and got our breath. I find out later, much later, that from what

19:41.320 --> 19:45.480
I understand, we were two or three seconds away from it, that continued to eventually crash

19:45.480 --> 19:48.400
in on the moon.

19:48.400 --> 19:57.320
It's one more reminder of the risks of trying to land men on the moon.

19:57.320 --> 20:06.400
July 1969. NASA is ready to take the final step. Apollo 11 will try for a landing. Neil Armstrong,

20:06.400 --> 20:12.360
Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin have sweated every detail from deploying experiments to scooping

20:12.360 --> 20:21.000
lunar soil. Armstrong is the commander. Everyone agrees there are none better.

20:21.000 --> 20:28.840
This was a cool guy and he had a reputation for being such an extremely skilled pilot

20:28.840 --> 20:33.640
who would keep his cool in very bad situations.

20:33.640 --> 20:38.880
Armstrong showed it when he narrowly cheated death during a test in the lunar landing research

20:38.880 --> 20:41.480
vehicle.

20:41.480 --> 20:47.240
He had to eject out of that at one point because the machine started to head badly and had

20:47.240 --> 20:51.840
he stayed with it, he would probably have been killed. So he had the ability to know

20:51.840 --> 20:56.080
when a situation was getting out of hand and he got out of there.

20:56.080 --> 21:03.040
Armstrong is not only good, he's lucky. 13 days before Apollo 11 is to lift off, his

21:03.040 --> 21:10.840
competitions suffers a mortal blow. The Soviets launch another N1 rocket and again it explodes.

21:10.840 --> 21:17.520
But this time the spy photos show the blast has completely destroyed the N1 launch pad.

21:17.520 --> 21:21.840
They had hopes of being able to scoop the US one more time. They weren't able to make

21:21.840 --> 21:28.120
that N1 work and ultimately that was the downfall of their moon program.

21:28.120 --> 21:33.320
The Soviets might be out of the race but they can still play the spoiler and they're

21:33.320 --> 21:41.000
secretly planning a last ditch end run as Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins prepare to fly.

21:41.000 --> 21:49.160
July 16th 1969, a day eight years in the making. 300 feet above the ground in the so-called

21:49.160 --> 21:54.040
white room at the top of the launch tower. Technicians are easing Neil Armstrong and

21:54.040 --> 22:01.000
Michael Collins into the Apollo 11 capsule. Buzz Aldrin is outside on the gantry alone

22:01.000 --> 22:07.560
with the towering Saturn V. The white room was up above me. I got off the elevator because

22:07.560 --> 22:12.440
they don't want too many people waiting around while they put in first one crewman then the other.

22:12.440 --> 22:17.480
The sun is just coming up and the peaceful waves are coming in. And I knew that this was a moment

22:17.480 --> 22:23.480
that I wanted to savor in some way and retell about because it was a moment of serenity.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.520
What did I know about what was going to happen in the next several days? But here it was

22:29.240 --> 22:32.120
and I thought this is the moment I just want to remember.

22:36.680 --> 22:43.480
In mission control the tension rises. Everyone feels the pressure to do well to be at the top of

22:43.480 --> 22:49.960
their form and in the last minutes before launch each man finds his own way to weather the countdown.

22:50.120 --> 22:56.760
For me it's a little bit of our father time. I mean I kind of realized we're going to light

22:56.760 --> 23:01.320
something off. It's pretty explosive. So I always take a moment to say a little prayer.

23:03.400 --> 23:08.440
Many of the flight controllers hold the power of a newborn or a go at any time.

23:09.560 --> 23:16.600
Many are hot shots in their 20s and 30s as arrogant and confident in their own abilities as the

23:16.600 --> 23:23.640
astronauts. They don't mind being out on the end of the diving board alone with nobody else.

23:23.640 --> 23:28.200
They'll make a decision and if they don't know how to do that they won't last.

23:29.000 --> 23:38.600
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 all engine run. Ripped off. We have a lift off.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.200
32 minutes past the hour. Ripped off in Apollo 11.

23:45.720 --> 23:50.280
Astronaut Michael Collins thinks they have only a 50-50 chance of succeeding.

23:51.880 --> 23:56.280
And on the flight to the moon the astronauts have written out of the flight plan anything that

23:56.280 --> 23:59.960
might be a distraction. They want to concentrate on what's ahead.

24:00.920 --> 24:07.480
We didn't really want to have distractions that were not contributing directly to the mission

24:07.480 --> 24:13.240
success which was a safe landing on the moon. A confidence that we knew what we were doing when

24:13.240 --> 24:18.280
we got there and on a safe departure. So there was a lot of time to just look out the window.

24:19.080 --> 24:27.800
But already circling the moon is Russia's last ditch ploy. An unmanned Soviet probe launched three

24:27.800 --> 24:36.280
days earlier to steal the glory of Apollo 11. Where do you people know that Apollo 11 astronauts were

24:36.280 --> 24:44.040
racing Russian robot to the moon? Luna 15's mission is to scoop 100 grams of lunar soil,

24:44.040 --> 24:48.760
then get back to Earth first. It's a preemptive strike that just might work.

24:49.880 --> 24:55.800
It would fly faster than Apollo 11. That's why the soil would be delivered approximately one day

24:55.800 --> 25:03.320
earlier than the Apollo 11 return to Earth. Then the Soviets could claim their robot accomplished

25:03.320 --> 25:10.280
what America needed three men to do. But for now Washington doesn't know Luna 15's purpose

25:10.280 --> 25:17.480
or orbit. So it takes an unusual step. It asks the Russians for details and gets an answer.

25:18.360 --> 25:25.560
Americans were very much concerned about this robot and they even issued the request to the Soviet

25:25.560 --> 25:32.840
government to ensure that Luna 15 would not hit Apollo 11. And Russian government even responded

25:33.160 --> 25:36.200
that there's no danger and the robot is under control.

25:40.200 --> 25:45.000
The next morning the eagle separates from Colombia and prepares for a landing.

25:49.480 --> 25:53.320
Neil Armstrong's focused like never before in his flying career.

25:53.800 --> 26:01.720
Eagle looking great, your go. And your whole concentration is on finding a place to land,

26:02.280 --> 26:10.760
a safe place to land. So if your Neil Armstrong in those last minutes, as soon as that lunar

26:10.760 --> 26:17.560
module pitches forward and begins the final descent, you are looking at the place where you're heading

26:17.560 --> 26:29.320
to see where the computer is taking you. Then at 33,000 feet there's a mission threatening alarm.

26:33.960 --> 26:40.280
And about that time why we we get a program alarm this interrupts our train. We know why you

26:40.280 --> 26:46.520
bothering me. Nothing's going wrong and yet you're flashing a program alarm and we don't understand.

26:47.560 --> 26:53.720
Mission control can see the eagle's computer is overloading. The 1202 alarm sends a

26:53.720 --> 26:58.680
adrenaline surging and a young controller out on the end of the diving board must make the

26:58.680 --> 27:06.360
decision of his life in seconds. Right here we got we're going at alarm. You go to continue to

27:06.360 --> 27:15.080
continue to keep the altitude now 21,000 feet still looking very good. Then at 16,000 feet,

27:15.080 --> 27:21.800
the computer shuts down again another alarm. I think there was a sense that if they didn't come too

27:21.800 --> 27:28.360
often, whatever too often meant I'm not sure. But if they didn't come too often, it was probably okay

27:28.360 --> 27:33.400
as long as everything else looked okay. Good radar data. We're now in the approach phase. Everything

27:33.880 --> 27:42.040
looking good. The eagle's close but it hasn't landed yet. And privately, a large percentage of the

27:42.040 --> 27:47.240
engineers back in Houston thought along the first attempt they would do that. That there would be an

27:47.240 --> 27:53.480
abort and probably number 12 or number 13 would be the ones that actually made the landing. That didn't

27:53.480 --> 28:00.600
happen because of the guy who was on the stick. altitude 42, how do you think you're going for landing over?

28:03.400 --> 28:20.680
I'm going to have to land up for landing 3000 feet. Now just a half a mile above the moon's surface,

28:20.680 --> 28:27.000
meal Armstrong has his hands full. Beside him Buzz Aldrin's eyes are glued to the computer screen,

28:27.000 --> 28:32.920
altitude rate of descent, forward movement. He's rattling off the numbers that Armstrong needs to

28:32.920 --> 28:51.160
land the eagle. Then there's another alarm. It's the last thing they need so close to the surface.

28:55.960 --> 28:59.880
Your attention is diverted by these alarms that could threaten the whole landing.

29:00.600 --> 29:05.960
And then once they tell you you can keep going, you look out the window again and my god there is a

29:05.960 --> 29:12.360
crater the size of a football field and it's got boulders around it that are as big as small cars.

29:12.360 --> 29:16.920
And this is the place where the computer is steering you for a landing.

29:19.240 --> 29:25.400
So the proven thing to do is to smoothly fly over that but that's also the thing that prolongs

29:25.960 --> 29:34.120
the mission but that consumes more fuel. Quickly Armstrong makes up his mind.

29:34.920 --> 29:40.120
He looked at his fuel he says I've got that distance to fly. I can fly this like a helicopter

29:40.120 --> 29:45.720
and I can go over there and put it down instead of here in the spiral rocks and that was all

29:45.720 --> 29:52.200
that was on Neil Armstrong's mind. But now the eagle has only 60 seconds of fuel.

29:56.120 --> 30:01.000
And you know it was getting a little close when 60 seconds was called out and the light came on

30:01.560 --> 30:05.320
and then we're still 100 feet off the surface.

30:09.240 --> 30:16.680
When we had 30 seconds and we're still I guess maybe 10, 15 feet. I felt we had it made then

30:16.680 --> 30:20.280
and it eased down. I could see the shadow and the dust coming up.

30:20.280 --> 30:25.320
We're picking up some dust. We're picking up some dust.

30:26.280 --> 30:32.440
And when he said that it hit me that my god there blowing dust off the moon.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.680
And so for the first time it had a realness to it.

30:38.040 --> 30:38.760
On that light.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.720
Okay engine stop. Copy it down Eagle.

30:44.680 --> 30:48.680
Listen, uh, tangoity base here. The Eagle has landed.

30:48.680 --> 30:54.200
Rocket twink, tranquility. We copy on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about the turn blue.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.720
We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.

30:57.320 --> 30:57.720
Thank you.

30:58.360 --> 31:08.760
And they landed with something like 20 seconds on the gauges which seems almost you know impossible

31:08.840 --> 31:12.920
but it can you know to a test pilot 20 seconds is a long time.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.280
We flew it in. We flew it in. God bless them.

31:17.720 --> 31:19.800
There is a hill in view.

31:19.800 --> 31:25.560
It has taken America eight long years and the pride shows in the astronaut snapshots.

31:26.840 --> 31:31.800
But now the world waits while Armstrong and Aldrin make sure they can leave quickly if there's

31:31.800 --> 31:36.760
an emergency. The weight is six and a half agonizing hours.

31:38.120 --> 31:42.920
And it was very disconcerting. I think to everybody back on Earth that it did take us so long

31:42.920 --> 31:49.080
but we felt it was so important to be very deliberate about all the steps that we were taking.

31:49.080 --> 31:53.400
And one of the things that I want to put into the flight plan as soon as we touched down

31:54.520 --> 31:59.800
I wanted to go through the rehearsal for liftoff two hours later.

32:00.760 --> 32:01.560
Finally.

32:05.560 --> 32:06.360
Roger Neil.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.280
Hey we're getting a fixture on the TV.

32:11.400 --> 32:16.360
And currently it's upside down on monitor but we can make out for him on a detail.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.440
Okay Neil we can see you're coming down the ladder now.

32:21.320 --> 32:25.480
600 million people are watching on TV around the world.

32:26.520 --> 32:27.960
I'm gonna step off the lam now.

32:30.520 --> 32:33.640
That's one small step for man.

32:33.640 --> 32:37.000
One giant leap for man.

32:39.640 --> 32:45.160
14 minutes later Buzz Aldrin steps out and groups for his own first words on the moon.

32:46.120 --> 32:48.360
It is magnificent desolation.

32:49.320 --> 32:50.360
Beautiful view.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.160
Is that something?

32:52.360 --> 32:53.800
Exdeficient desolation.

32:54.760 --> 33:02.120
It was not my assignment to come up with a clever meaningful pronouncement upon my reaching the surface.

33:03.400 --> 33:10.920
But that's something that impressed upon me at the time the magnificence of the achievement that we

33:10.920 --> 33:15.480
were a part of but what a desolate world we were visiting.

33:15.480 --> 33:22.920
I'm strong and Aldrin have just enough time two hours to plant a flag, dedicate a plaque.

33:23.880 --> 33:27.240
And speak to a president.

33:28.920 --> 33:44.120
And while they rest the Soviets make their move but something goes wrong very wrong.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.600
Russia's desperate attempt to scoop lunar soil and get it back to earth first fails abruptly.

33:51.560 --> 33:58.440
According to the schedule lunar 15 was supposed to land a day later after Apollo 11.

33:59.640 --> 34:00.920
But it crashed on the moon.

34:01.960 --> 34:06.760
The crash kills the Soviets last chance to steal Apollo 11's thunder.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.280
There are guidance recommendations.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.400
Is things your cleared for takeoff?

34:15.000 --> 34:17.480
Roger understand. We're number one on the runway.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.000
Roger.

34:21.240 --> 34:24.840
That was beautiful.

34:24.840 --> 34:27.240
When he takes 36 feet, he's just acting up.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.800
I'm gonna take the over.

34:31.560 --> 34:32.360
Very smooth.

34:37.080 --> 34:40.120
After Apollo 11 everything seems possible.

34:40.920 --> 34:46.280
NASA plans nine more moon missions and then a shot of landing a man on Mars.

34:51.480 --> 34:59.480
As America celebrates the safe return of its first moonwalkers, one space warrior knows the battle is done.

35:01.160 --> 35:08.520
Final analysis at that point I knew that a very significant battle in the cold war had been won.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.920
I lost an awful lot of France in Korea.

35:11.560 --> 35:16.520
You can argue that we didn't win that one and we won this one.

35:20.760 --> 35:22.440
Okay, battle has to go.

35:22.440 --> 35:23.160
Looks good here.

35:23.160 --> 35:23.960
Flight good agreement.

35:25.560 --> 35:31.080
But in the end Apollo 11 will be a symbol of far more than a cold war triumph.

35:31.080 --> 35:31.800
It's going on.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.080
Yeah really?

35:33.080 --> 35:33.640
Flight.

35:33.640 --> 35:34.440
Roger.

35:34.440 --> 35:39.080
The significance is not really in the rocks that we brought back.

35:39.080 --> 35:44.120
It wasn't the significance of what anybody really said, the poetic, whatever.

35:44.120 --> 35:49.400
It was that so many people's lives were affected and when they think about they say,

35:49.400 --> 35:51.480
I don't remember where I was when that happened.

35:52.120 --> 35:52.520
Why?

35:52.520 --> 35:55.000
Because it had an impact on their lives.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.440
It had a positive impact.

35:56.440 --> 36:01.080
And that really, to me, is a human spiritual value of that.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.000
It's a human value totally.

36:04.120 --> 36:10.200
I still have an amazing feeling when I go out and look at the moon come up and think about the fact that

36:10.840 --> 36:16.840
all of this really happened and that it happened in my lifetime and I was there to see it.

36:16.840 --> 36:20.360
I think all of us who were alive when Apollo

36:21.080 --> 36:24.440
happened are really lucky to have those memories.

36:24.440 --> 36:39.240
All of the spectacular, just spectacular.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.240
Wow.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.240
Very true, beautiful.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.040
I got a deep love in the rocks.

36:44.040 --> 36:44.840
That's great.

36:44.840 --> 36:50.040
By the early 1970s, astronauts are frolicing on the moon.

36:51.000 --> 36:56.680
But who could imagine that America's fascination with exploring space would fade so quickly?

36:57.480 --> 37:02.840
Washington is faced with a host of earthbound troubles and it starts lopping NASA's missions.

37:04.040 --> 37:09.880
The pressures of the Vietnam War were there and the politicians had the sense that,

37:09.880 --> 37:10.920
well, we've done it now.

37:10.920 --> 37:11.720
What?

37:11.720 --> 37:13.080
Here we'd landed on the moon.

37:13.800 --> 37:19.000
We'd done something that people had dreamt about for, you know, hundreds if not thousands of years.

37:19.800 --> 37:24.520
And by the second time it happens, people are already starting to get jaded.

37:26.360 --> 37:27.960
April 1970.

37:28.680 --> 37:34.040
Less than a year after the first moon landing, Apollo doesn't even rate live TV coverage.

37:35.080 --> 37:42.200
Jim Lovell, Jack Swaggerton, Fred Hayes, the crew of Apollo 13 are just another forgettable mission.

37:42.200 --> 37:42.840
At first.

37:49.880 --> 37:50.760
Here's what we've had about.

37:51.880 --> 38:01.160
205,000 miles from home and explosion cripples Apollo 13 and swiftly focuses attention again on the moon missions.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.560
Okay, now that's everybody keep cool.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.400
We got a limestone attach.

38:05.960 --> 38:09.480
A young Glenn Loney is one of the flight directors on Apollo 13.

38:10.120 --> 38:14.440
We think we have the situation in control.

38:14.440 --> 38:15.240
We project the...

38:15.240 --> 38:23.240
This terrible sinking feeling, you know, like I'd been kicked in the stomach that, wow, we've got ourselves a difficult thing here.

38:24.360 --> 38:29.560
Mission control faces its most challenging task ever, a space rescue.

38:30.200 --> 38:37.880
It has to bring back three men alive, losing a crew in space now would surely cancel the remaining Apollo missions.

38:39.320 --> 38:42.520
Houston finds a way to bring the crew back a day early.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.600
But to do so, Apollo 13 will have to fire its engine briefly to align itself with Earth.

38:49.160 --> 38:54.920
If the capsule isn't pointed in the right direction, the crew will skip off the Earth's atmosphere.

38:55.960 --> 39:01.080
So mission control tells the crew to take a sighting on an object it can't miss.

39:02.280 --> 39:07.320
If they were accurate, if the navigation system was accurate, they'd see the sun right in the crosshairs.

39:07.880 --> 39:18.040
And, you know, if it wasn't accurate, they were in big trouble because that meant that they had no way of aligning their navigation system to make the rocket firing to get them home.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.840
A young Jerry Griffin is on duty.

39:21.640 --> 39:27.720
He's listening and he hears Jim Lovell say, what have you got? What do you see, Fred?

39:27.720 --> 39:31.880
And Fred says, I've got the upper right corner of the sun and Lovell says, we've got it.

39:32.600 --> 39:37.560
Lovell says, I've got it. He yelled it essentially on the, I've got it.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.160
And I was trying to keep notes in the flight director log.

39:41.160 --> 39:46.600
And when I went back here, or even weeks later and looked at it, I could not read my writing.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.160
My hand, I was so excited.

39:49.160 --> 39:55.080
His hand was shaking from the tension so badly that he could barely read his own writing.

40:02.680 --> 40:07.480
The drama had recaptured the world's attention.

40:08.200 --> 40:11.880
But when it's over, the Apollo missions fade from sight once more.

40:18.680 --> 40:25.880
Two and a half years later, December 1972, Eugene Surnin is a top of Saturn 5 again.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.440
It's getting off the top and it's lighting up the areas.

40:34.440 --> 40:36.760
It's just like daylight here at Kennedy Space Center.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.760
The Saturn 5 is moving off the pad.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.760
It is now clear of the tower.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.760
Turn off the plate.

40:42.760 --> 40:45.560
The sun is setting on the Apollo program.

40:45.560 --> 40:48.520
This will be America's last trip to the moon.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.720
38 degrees.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.160
Dallanjee, I go over.

40:53.160 --> 40:59.880
But this time, the man who blaze the trail for Apollo 11 and stopped short makes it all the way down.

41:00.840 --> 41:04.760
OK, then by perpetual verse or week coming in.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.440
Picture is proceeded.

41:08.440 --> 41:10.680
And there it is, here's the nurse Camelock.

41:10.680 --> 41:11.080
Why?

41:11.080 --> 41:11.880
I'll target.

41:11.880 --> 41:12.680
I see it.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.680
Dallanjee, I go for landing.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.320
Ten feet.

41:16.680 --> 41:17.640
That contact.

41:18.440 --> 41:21.880
Yes, then you can tell America that Challenger is a torseless role.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.480
I should challenge her that's a super.

41:23.480 --> 41:28.440
Finally, Eugene Surnin is on the moon and at peace.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.880
And you've never known silence.

41:33.240 --> 41:36.680
Requirements are stillness in your entire life.

41:36.680 --> 41:40.840
And there are the dust stops, the noise stops, the movement stops.

41:41.400 --> 41:47.000
And to remind you of what it's all about is the earth surrounded by blackness.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.320
Overpowering three dimensional blackness.

41:49.320 --> 41:52.360
A blackness that I call the infinity of time and the infinity of space.

41:52.360 --> 41:53.800
And I don't know what that means.

41:53.800 --> 41:56.680
I can't show it to you, but I know it exists because I saw it with my own eyes.

41:59.160 --> 42:01.080
So, that coming.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.960
Jack Schmidt having a few problems.

42:04.920 --> 42:08.280
Astronaut Jack Schmidt, a geologist and Surnin,

42:08.280 --> 42:11.800
spend three days on the surface, longer than any other mission.

42:12.680 --> 42:19.320
And at a crater named Shorty, they make the biggest scientific discovery of the entire Apollo program.

42:19.320 --> 42:24.040
Oh, hey, there is orange soil.

42:24.040 --> 42:25.880
Well, don't move it, Dallanjee.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.360
It's all over.

42:28.360 --> 42:30.360
Orange.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.360
Dallanjee, do I see it?

42:32.360 --> 42:34.360
I've started up with my feet.

42:34.360 --> 42:35.320
Hey, it is.

42:35.320 --> 42:36.760
I can see it from here.

42:36.760 --> 42:37.560
It's orange.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.040
And then when he found the orange soil, I said,

42:40.040 --> 42:44.360
uh, first time I saw it, I thought, oh my god, Jack's been here too long.

42:44.360 --> 42:46.600
You know, he's going to find something.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.880
And I went over to look at it and by god, it was orange.

42:49.880 --> 42:51.240
I couldn't believe it.

42:51.240 --> 42:52.280
It truly was orange.

42:52.280 --> 42:55.400
And it was only literally the only color other than shades of gray.

42:55.400 --> 42:56.680
We found it in the surface moon.

42:56.680 --> 42:59.080
And I don't think anyone expected us to find it at all.

43:00.280 --> 43:03.480
The orange soil is evidence of ancient lava flow

43:04.840 --> 43:05.960
for little time left.

43:07.080 --> 43:08.280
We like to leave it immediately.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.600
My godly, this time goes fast.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.640
It is an experience like none other.

43:16.600 --> 43:17.240
You're there.

43:18.280 --> 43:19.800
You're happy to be there.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.960
And you know, you got to have fun.

43:21.960 --> 43:24.440
One thing I told Ron Evans and Jack's man,

43:24.440 --> 43:27.080
I said, you're only going to come this way one time and enjoy it.

43:27.080 --> 43:28.920
Don't miss a thing.

43:28.920 --> 43:29.720
Just in...

43:45.960 --> 43:46.280
Then it's over.

43:47.160 --> 43:52.120
Eugene Surnin has known for a long time that his will be the last footprints on the moon.

43:52.760 --> 43:57.800
When I took those last steps, I wanted someone to recognize the significance,

43:57.800 --> 44:02.360
the importance of man having walked on the moon during the 20th century.

44:02.360 --> 44:10.440
I'd like to just let what I believe history will report that American challenge up today

44:11.800 --> 44:15.000
has forced man's destiny up tomorrow.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.600
I felt the challenge that we accepted

44:19.560 --> 44:25.560
and what we had accomplished there are no short few years that we now call the Apollo years.

44:26.280 --> 44:28.840
Truly has opened the door of the future.

44:28.840 --> 44:31.720
Truly has told mankind we can...

44:31.720 --> 44:33.720
we need to go further. We need to do more.

44:41.480 --> 44:46.040
Apollo 17 writes the last chapter in the Great Adventure.

44:46.280 --> 44:54.520
I do think history will look back and say, my gosh, those folks did that back in the mid-1900s

44:54.520 --> 45:01.800
essentially. Did that in the mid-1900s and then didn't do anything to follow up on it,

45:01.800 --> 45:03.400
maybe for another hundred years.

45:04.040 --> 45:06.280
And that's going to be kind of an over.

45:06.280 --> 45:06.600
Why?

45:07.800 --> 45:11.080
Four, three, two, one,

45:11.720 --> 45:16.760
zero, we have oothed recognition and liftoff of the spatial discovery as NASA.

45:16.760 --> 45:23.480
Today the shuttle keeps a man presence in space, though at an earth hugging altitude of 350 miles.

45:24.200 --> 45:30.600
Mars is what counts now. And humans could land there as early as the year 2012,

45:30.600 --> 45:35.800
maybe 2019, says NASA. But nothing is carved in stone.

45:36.760 --> 45:40.680
I think the question of human destiny is an important one here,

45:40.680 --> 45:46.680
and whether or not we become a galactic people as opposed to an earth bound people.

45:48.520 --> 45:52.200
But when a decision is made to explore deep space again,

45:52.760 --> 45:58.120
man will follow in the footsteps of some lucky man, some very lucky man,

45:58.760 --> 46:04.760
the first to look back from the moon, to a fragile planet they called home.

46:06.360 --> 46:12.040
They look at a photograph with somebody interviews them and they're reminded of an extraordinary

46:12.040 --> 46:19.160
thing that they were lucky enough to be part of, and a place in history and an experience that's

46:19.160 --> 46:25.400
literally unique in all of humanity. Their experience will always be unique.

46:25.400 --> 46:30.920
There will never again be another group of people who were first to go to another world.

46:30.920 --> 46:40.040
God shit, was it? I feel so lucky to have been there. I feel so fortunate to have participated.
